With the increasing velocity of digital content and the increasing availability of powerful creation and editing techniques, establishing the provenance of media is critical to ensure transparency, understanding, and ultimately, trust. We are witnessing extraordinary challenges to trust in media. As social platforms amplify the reach and influence of certain content via ever more complex and opaque algorithms, mis-attributed and mis-contextualized content spreads quickly. Whether inadvertent misinformation or deliberate deception via disinformation, inauthentic content is on the rise. Currently, creators who wish to include metadata about their work (for example, authorship) cannot do so in a secure, tamper-evident and standardized way across platforms. Without this attribution information, publishers and consumers lack critical context for determining the authenticity of media. Provenance empowers content creators and editors, regardless of their geographic location or degree of access to technology, to disclose information about who created or changed an asset, what was changed and how it was changed. Content with provenance provides indicators of authenticity so that consumers can have awareness of who has altered content and what exactly has been changed. This ability to provide provenance for creators, publishers and consumers is essential to facilitating trust online. To address this issue at scale for publishers, creators and consumers, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has developed this technical specification for providing content provenance and authenticity. It is designed to enable global, opt-in, adoption of digital provenance techniques through the creation of a rich ecosystem of digital provenance enabled applications for a wide range of individuals and organizations while meeting appropriate security requirements. This specification has been, and continues to be, informed by scenarios, workflows and requirements gathered from industry experts and partner organizations, including the Project Origin Alliance and the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI). It is also possible that regulatory bodies and governmental agencies could utilize this specification to establish standards for digital provenance. This specification describes the technical aspects of the C2PA architecture; a model for storing and accessing cryptographically verifiable information whose trustworthiness can be assessed based on a defined trust model. Included in this document is information about how to create and process a C2PA Manifest and its components, including the use of digital signature technology for enabling tamper-evidence as well as establishing trust. Prior to developing this specification, the C2PA created our Guiding Principles that enabled us to remain focused on ensuring that the specification can be used in ways that respect privacy and personal control of data with a critical eye toward potential abuse and misuse. For example, the creators and publishers of the media assets always have control over whether provenance data is included as well as what specific pieces of data are included. From the overarching goals section of the guiding principles: C2PA specifications SHOULD NOT provide value judgments about whether a given set of provenance data is 'good' or 'bad,' merely whether the assertions included within can be validated as associated with the underlying asset, correctly formed, and free from tampering. It is important that the specification does not negatively impact content accessibility for consumers. Other documents from the C2PA will address specific implementation considerations such as expected user experiences and details of our threat and harms modelling. The C2PA information comprises a series of statements that cover areas such as asset creation, authorship, edit actions, capture device details, bindings to content and many other subjects. These statements, called Assertions, make up the provenance of a given asset and represent a series of trust signals that can be used by a human to improve their view of trustworthiness concerning the asset. Assertions are wrapped up with additional information into a digitally signed entity called a Claim. The W3C Verifiable Credentials of individual actors that are involved in the creation of the assertions can be added to the C2PA information to provide additional trust signals to the process of assessing trustworthiness of the asset. These assertions, claims, credentials and signatures are all bound together into a verifiable unit called a C2PA Manifest by a hardware or software component called a Claim Generator. The set of C2PA Manifests, as stored in the asset’s C2PA Manifest Store, represent its provenance data. Figure 1. A C2PA Manifest and its constituent parts The basis of making trust decisions in C2PA, our Trust Model, is the identity of the actor associated with the cryptographic signing key used to sign the claim in the Active Manifest. The identity of a signatory is not necessarily a human actor, and the identity presented may be a pseudonym, completely anonymous, or pertain to a service or trusted hardware device with its own identity, including an application running inside such a service or trusted hardware. C2PA Manifests can be validated indefinitely regardless of whether the cryptographic credentials used to sign its contents are later expired or revoked. A very common scenario will be a user (called an actor in the C2PA ecosystem) taking a photograph with their C2PA-enabled camera (or phone). In that instance, the camera would create a manifest containing some such assertions including information about the camera itself, a thumbnail of the image and some cryptographic hashes that bind the photograph to the manifest. These assertions would then be listed in the Claim, which would be digitally signed and then the entire manifest would be embedded into the output JPEG. This manifest would remain valid indefinitely. Figure 2. Example C2PA Manifest of a Photograph A Manifest Consumer, such as a C2PA Validator, could help users to establish the trustworthiness of the asset by first validating the digital signature and its associated credential. It can also check each of the assertions for validity and present the information contained in them, and the signature, to the user in a way that they can then make an informed decision about the trustworthiness of the digital content. In the creation of the C2PA architecture, it was important to establish some clear goals for the work to ensure that the technology was usable across a wide spectrum of hardware and software implementations worldwide and accessible to all. Goal Description Privacy Enable actors to control the privacy of their information, including identity, consumption data and information recorded in provenance Responsibility Ensure consumers can determine the provenance of an asset Scalability Enable creation/consumption/validation of media provenance at the same scale as media creation/consumption on the web Extensibility Ensure future metadata and credential providers are able to add their information without requiring input or approval from the C2PA Interoperability Ensure that differing implementations are able to operate with each other without ambiguity Whole Workflow Applicability Maintain the provenance of the asset across multiple tools, from creation through all subsequent modification and publication/distribution Technology Minimalism Create only the minimum required novel technology in the specification by relying on prior, well-established techniques Security Design to ensure that consumers can trust the integrity and source of provenance, and ensure the design is reviewed by experts Content Ubiquity Enable the inclusion of provenance for all common media types, including documents Flexible Locality Enable both online and offline (asset-only) storage and consumption/validation of provenance Global Universality Design for the needs of interested users throughout the world Accessibility Ensure that the technology can be used in a way that conform to recognized accessibility standards, such as WCAG Harms and Misuse Design to avert and mitigate potential harms, including threats to human rights and disproportionate risks to vulnerable groups Evolving Continuous review of the specification against these goals to ensure that they remain our priority A human or non-human (hardware or software) that is participating in the C2PA ecosystem. For example: a camera (capture device), image editing software, cloud service or the person using such tools. An organization or group of actors may also be considered an actor in the C2PA ecosystem. An actor (human or non-human) whose credential’s private key is used to sign the claim. The signer is identified by the subject of the credential. The non-human (hardware or software) actor that generates the claim about an asset as well as the claim signature, thus leading to the asset's associated manifest. An actor who consumes an asset with an associated manifest for the purpose of obtaining the provenance data from the manifest. A manifest consumer whose role is to perform the actions described in Chapter 15, Validation. An operation performed by an actor on an asset. For example, \"create\", \"embed\", or \"apply filter\". The portion of an asset that represents the actual content, such as the pixels of an image, along with any additional technical metadata required to understand the content (e.g., a colour profile or encoding parameters). The portion of an asset that represents non-technical information about the asset and its digital content, as may be stored via standards such as Exif or XMP. A file or stream of data containing digital content, asset metadata and optionally, a C2PA Manifest. For the purposes of this definition, we will extend the typical definition of \"file\" to include cloud-native and dynamically generated data. A derived asset is an asset that is created by starting from an existing asset and performing actions to it that modify its digital content and asset metadata. EXAMPLE: An audio stream that has been shortened or a document where pages have been added. A representation of an asset (either as a part of an asset or a completely new asset) where the digital content has had a 'non-editorial transformation' action (e.g., re-encoding or scaling) applied but where the asset metadata has not been modified. EXAMPLE: A video file that is re-encoded for reduced screen resolution or network bandwidth. A composed asset is an asset that is created by building up a collection of multiple parts or fragments of digital content (referred to as ingredients) from one or more other assets. When starting from an existing asset, it is a special case of a derived asset - however a composed asset can also be one that starts from a \"blank slate\". EXAMPLES: A video created by importing existing video clips and audio segments into a \"blank slate\". An image where another image is imported and super-imposed on top of the starting image. A data structure which represents a statement asserted by an actor concerning the asset. This data is a part of the C2PA Manifest. A digitally signed and tamper-evident data structure that references a set of assertions by one or more actors, concerning an asset, and the information necessary to represent the content binding. If any assertions were redacted, then a declaration to that effect is included. This data is a part of the C2PA Manifest. The digital signature on the claim using the private key of an actor. The claim signature is a part of the C2PA Manifest. The set of information about the provenance of an asset based on the combination of one or more assertions (including content bindings), a single claim, and a claim signature. A C2PA Manifest is part of a C2PA Manifest Store. A C2PA Manifest can reference other C2PA Manifests. A collection of C2PA Manifests that can either be embedded into an asset or be external to its asset. The C2PA Manifest in the provenance data which represents the software or device that initially created the asset. Details on how one determines which C2PA Manifest is the origin are left for specification. The last manifest in the list of C2PA Manifests inside of a C2PA Manifest Store which is the one with the set of content bindings that are able to be validated. The logical concept of understanding the history of an asset and its interaction with actors and other assets, as represented by the provenance data. The set of C2PA Manifests for an asset and, in the case of a composed asset, its ingredients. A C2PA Manifest can reference other C2PA Manifests. A property of digital content comprising a set of facts (provenance data and hard bindings) that can be cryptographically verified as not having been tampered with. Information that associates digital content to a specific C2PA Manifest associated with a specific asset, either as a hard binding or a soft binding. One or more cryptographic hashes that uniquely identifies either the entire asset or a portion thereof. A content identifier that is either (a) not statistically unique, such as a fingerprint, or (b) embedded as a watermark in the identified digital content. The collection of information that can inform an actor’s judgment of the trustworthiness of an asset. These are in addition to the signer of a claim, upon which the fundamental trust model relies. A set of inherent properties computable from digital content that identifies the content or near duplicates of it. EXAMPLE: An asset can become separated from its manifest due to removal or corruption of asset metadata. A fingerprint of the digital content of the asset could be used to search a database to recover the asset with an intact manifest. Information incorporated into the digital content (perceptibly or imperceptibly) of an asset which can be used, for example, to uniquely identify the asset or to store a reference to a C2PA Manifest. A repository into which C2PA Manifests and C2PA Manifest Stores can be placed, and which can be searched using a content binding. This image shows how all these various elements come together to represent the C2PA architecture. Figure 3.

JUMBF & W3C VC Data Model) 1.0 - December 2021 Initial Release It is expected that each of the actors in the system that creates or processes an asset will produce one or more assertions about when, where, and how the asset was originated or transformed. An assertion is labelled data, typically (though not required to be) in a CBOR-based structure which represents a declaration made by an actor about an asset. Some of these actors will be human and add human-generated information (e.g., copyright) while other actors are machines (software/hardware) providing the information they generated (e.g., camera type). Some examples of assertions are: Exif information (e.g. camera information such as maker, lens) Actions performed on the asset (e.g., clipping, color correction) Thumbnail of the asset or its ingredients Content bindings (e.g., cryptographic hashes) Certain assertions may be redacted by subsequent claims (see Section 6.7, “Redaction of Assertions”), but they cannot be modified once made as part of a claim. Each assertion has a label defined either by the C2PA specifications or an external entity. Labels are string values organized into namespaces using a period (.) as a separator. The namespace component of the label can be an entity, or a reference to a well-established standard (see ABNF below). The most common labels will be defined by the C2PA and will begin with c2pa.. Entity-specific labels shall begin with the Internet domain name for the entity similar to how Java packages are defined (e.g., com.litware, net.fineartschool). Well-established standards can use the \"stds.\" prefix when describing their namespace. They are also versioned with a simple incrementing integer scheme (e.g., c2pa.actions.v2). If no version is provided, it is considered as v1. The list of publicly known labels can be found in Chapter 18, C2PA Standard Assertions. namespaced-label = qualified-namespace label qualified-namespace = entity / ( \"stds.\" std-name ) entity = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / \"-\" ) std-name = 1*( DIGIT / ALPHA / \"-\" ) label = 1*(\".\" 1(ALPHA / \"_\" ) *( DIGIT / ALPHA / \"_\" ) ) The period-separated components of a label follow the variable naming convention ([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*) specified in the POSIX or C locale, with the restriction that the use of a repeated underscore character (__) is reserved for labelling multiple assertions of the same type. When an assertion’s schema is changed, it should be done in a backwards-compatible manner. This means that new fields may be added and existing ones may be marked as deprecated (i.e., can be read, but never written). Existing fields shall not be removed. The label would then consist of an incremented version number, for example moving from c2pa.hash.bmff (deprecated) to c2pa.hash.bmff.v2. Deprecated fields for C2PA standard assertions shall be indicated in Chapter 18, C2PA Standard Assertions. Tools which enable actors to create assertions shall prevent the actor from inserting data into deprecated assertion fields. In addition, there are situations where a non-backwards compatible change is required. In that case, instead of increasing the label’s version number, the assertion shall be given a new label. For example, c2pa.ingredient could be changed to the fictional c2pa.component. Multiple assertions of the same type can occur in the same manifest, but since assertions are referenced by claims via their label, the assertion labels must be unique. This is accomplished by adding a double-underscore and a monotonically increasing index to the label. For example, if a manifest contains a single assertion of type stds.schema-org.CreativeWork, then the assertion label will be stds.schema-org.CreativeWork. If a manifest contains three assertions of this type, the labels will be stds.schema-org.CreativeWork, stds.schema-org.CreativeWork__1 and stds.schema-org.CreativeWork__2. When a label includes a version number, that version number is part of the label itself. As such, when there are multiple instances, the instance number continues to follow the label - e.g., c2pa.ingredient.v2__2. The set of assertions referenced by a claim in a manifest are collected together into a logical construct that is referred to as the assertion store. The assertions and assertion store shall be stored as described in Section 11.1, “Use of JUMBF”; in particular, the assertion store shall be located in the same C2PA Manifest box as the claim that refers to its assertions. For each manifest, there is a single assertion store associated with it. However, as an asset may have multiple manifests associated with it, each one representing a specific series of assertions, there may be multiple assertion stores associated with an asset. Some assertion data, due to its size or an infrequent need for it, may be externally hosted. Such data are not embedded in the assertion store, but instead are referenced by URI. This is accomplished through a cloud data assertion (see Section 18.8, “Cloud Data”). Unlike embedded assertion data, cloud data is not retrieved nor validated as part of manifest validation, and are only retrieved and validated when specifically needed by an application according to a different set of validation rules as described in Section 15.7, “Validate the Assertions”. Assertions that are present in an asset-embedded manifest may be removed from that asset’s manifest when the asset is used as an ingredient. This process is called redaction. Redaction involves removing either the entire assertion from the manifest’s assertion store or retaining the labelled assertion container but replacing its data with zeros (binary \\0 values). In addition, a record that something was removed must be added to the claim in the form of a URI reference to the redaction assertion in the redacted_assertions field of the claim. Because each assertion’s URI reference includes the assertion label, it is also known what type of information (e.g., thumbnail, IPTC metadata, etc.) was removed. This enables both humans and machines to apply rules to determine if the removal was acceptable. Unless the redaction of the assertion also requires modification to the digital content, an update manifest shall be used to document the redaction as it makes a statement about the non-changes to the content. Claims generators shall not redact assertions with a label of c2pa.actions as this assertion type represents essential information in understanding the history of an asset. Every asset that is referenced by the claim shall be referenced via a unique identifier. In addition, these identifiers are used in various parts of a C2PA-enabled workflow, such as when identifying it as an ingredient in a derived or composed asset. When an asset contains embedded XMP, that XMP shall include (at least) values for xmpMM:DocumentID and xmpMM:InstanceID as defined in XMP Specification Part 2, 2.2. If an asset does not contain XMP at the time a claim is made, and the type of the asset supports it, an embedded XMP packet may be created as part of the process, and the identifiers shall be added to it. NOTE 1 Some asset types are not suited for embedded XMP (e.g., text). It is possible to create XMP as a sidecar. Instead of using XMP, a unique identifier for an asset could be a URI defined by standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DID), Handle, EIDR and DOI. Another standard unique identifier for an asset could be the cryptographic hash of the asset. When this method is used, the hash shall be represented using a standard RFC 4122 UUID following the recommendations at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-thiemann-hash-urn-01 . EDITORS NOTE Other methods may be defined here as they are developed. All references to information in the manifest, whether stored internally to the asset (i.e., embedded) or stored externally to the asset (e.g., in the cloud), shall be referenced via JUMBF URI references as defined in ISO 19566-5, C.2. These URIs shall be used either as part of a hashed_uri or hashed_ext_uri data structure. A hashed_uri is used when the URI is for something embedded in the same manifest store. { \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema\", \"$id\": \"http://ns.c2pa.org/hashed-uri/v1\", \"type\": \"object\", \"description\": \"The data structure used to store a reference to a local URL and its hash\", \"definitions\": { \"JUMBF_URI\": { \"$id\": \"#JUMBF_URI\", \"description\": \"JUMBF URI reference\", \"type\": \"string\", \"pattern\": \"^self#jumbf=[\\\\w\\\\d][\\\\w\\\\d\\\\./:-]+[\\\\w\\\\d]$\" } }, \"examples\": [ { \"url\": \"self#jumbf=c2pa/urn:uuid:F9168C5E-CEB2-4faa-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4/c2pa.assertions/c2pa.actions\", \"alg\": \"sha256\", \"hash\": \"hoOspQQ1lFTy/4Tp8Epx670E5QW5NwkNR+2b30KFXug=\" } ], \"required\": [\"url\", \"hash\"], \"properties\": { \"url\": { \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/JUMBF_URI\", \"description\": \"JUMBF URI reference\" }, \"alg\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"minLength\": 1, \"description\": \"A string identifying the cryptographic hash algorithm used to compute all hashes in this claim, taken from the C2PA hash algorithm identifier list.

These self#jumbf URIs may be relative to the entire C2PA Manifest Store, in which case they shall start with a / (U+002F, Slash), or relative to the current C2PA Manifest. URIs shall not contain the sequence .. (a pair of U+002E, Full Stop). When referring to a resource that exists externally to the manifest store, a hashed-ext-uri-map data structure is used. This is described in Section 18.8, “Cloud Data”. EXAMPLES: self#jumbf=/c2pa/urn:uuid:f095f30e-6cd5-4bf7-8c44-ce8420ca9fb7/c2pa.assertions/c2pa.thumbnail.claim.jpeg is relative to the entire store (since it starts with /), self#jumbf=c2pa.assertions/c2pa.thumbnail.claim.jpeg would be relative to the manifest of the box containing the URI. When creating a URI reference to an assertion (i.e., as part of constructing a Claim), a W3C Verifiable Credential or other C2PA structure stored as a JUMBF box, the hash shall be performed over the contents of the structure’s JUMBF superbox, which includes both the JUMBF Description Box and all content boxes therein (but does not include the structure’s JUMBF superbox header). More details on hashing can be found at Section 13.1, “Hashing”. As described in the forthcoming dated revision to JUMBF (ISO 19566-5:2022/3), a new Private field can be present as part of any JUMBF Description box. This C2PA specification defines the C2PA salt as a Private field whose value is a standard box consisting of: a box length (LBox, as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer) a box type (TBox, 4-byte big-endian unsigned integer, with a value of c2sh (for C2PA salt hash)) and payload data (consisting of randomly-generated binary data of either 16 or 32 bytes in length). Figure 4. Example c2pa.actions assertion In some use cases, the actors in the system may wish to provide their own W3C Verifiable Credential, as they exist at that moment in time, to the claim generator to have them associated with one or more assertions. These actors may be individuals, groups or organizations. W3C Verifiable Credentials are used in this specification to decorate the actors identified in assertions with more information, potentially providing additional trust signals. Although these W3C Verifiable Credentials can include proofs of their own authenticity, they are not a mechanism for verifying that a particular actor authorised a claim, assertion or piece of metadata. Any validation or usage of the W3C Verifiable Credential is out of scope of this specification and has no bearing on the C2PA Trust Model. For example, conveying a W3C Verifiable Credential for the actor identified as the author in an assertion might link that author’s ID with an email address, social media ID, or real name, or it might identify that actor as a member of a particular professional body, or provide other qualifications relevant to the actor’s involvement in the asset. Such credentials shall be compliant with the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model using the JSON-LD serialisation described there. JSON-LD serialization is mandated as it is the most commonly used of the three syntaxes presented in section 6 of the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification. It is also the one that aligns best with its extensibility model, which could be useful to some implementers. An example of a compliant credential for an individual might be one issued by the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA), which links an identifier for a person to their name (\"John Doe\") and a statement about their membership of the NPPA. It might look like: { \"@context\": [ \"https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1\", \"http://schema.org\" ], \"type\": [ \"VerifiableCredential\", \"NPPACredential\" ], \"issuer\": \"https://nppa.org/\", \"credentialSubject\": { \"id\": \"did:nppa:eb1bb9934d9896a374c384521410c7f14\", \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"memberOf\": \"https://nppa.org/\" }, \"proof\": { \"type\": \"RsaSignature2018\", \"created\": \"2021-06-18T21:19:10Z\", \"proofPurpose\": \"assertionMethod\", \"verificationMethod\": \"did:nppa:eb1bb9934d9896a374c384521410c7f14#_Qq0UL2Fq651Q0Fjd6TvnYE-faHiOpRlPVQcY_-tA4A\", \"jws\": \"eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19 DJBMvvFAIC00nSGB6Tn0XKbbF9XrsaJZREWvR2aONYTQQxnyXirtXnlewJMB Bn2h9hfcGZrvnC1b6PgWmukzFJ1IiH1dWgnDIS81BH-IxXnPkbuYDeySorc4 QU9MJxdVkY5EL4HYbcIfwKj6X4LBQ2_ZHZIu1jdqLcRZqHcsDF5KKylKc1TH n5VRWy5WhYg_gBnyWny8E6Qkrze53MR7OuAmmNJ1m1nN8SxDrG6a08L78J0- Fbas5OjAQz3c17GY8mVuDPOBIOVjMEghBlgl3nOi1ysxbRGhHLEK4s0KKbeR ogZdgt1DkQxDFxxn41QWDw_mmMCjs9qxg0zcZzqEJw\" } } A W3C Verifiable Credential used with C2PA shall contain only a single credentialSubject and that credentialSubject shall have an id value. Although the example above and many examples in the W3C Verifiable Credentials data model specification use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as the value of the id field, DIDs are not necessary for W3C Verifiable Credentials to be useful. Specifically, W3C Verifiable Credentials do not depend on DIDs and DIDs do not depend on W3C Verifiable Credentials. DID-based URLs are just one way to express identifiers associated with subjects, issuers, holders, credential status lists, cryptographic keys, and other machine-readable information associated with a W3C Verifiable Credential. The set of credentials in a manifest are collected together into a logical construct that is referred to as the credential store or VCStore (for short) and it shall be stored as described in Section 11.1, “Use of JUMBF”. Just as with the assertion store, the VCStore shall always be included/embedded in the JUMBF - it is not stored separately. For each manifest, there is a VCStore associated with it. However, as an asset may have multiple manifests associated with it, there may be multiple VCStores associated with an asset. Some assertions, such as Creative Work and Actions, may contain references to Persons or Organisations which are responsible for various roles and responsibilities. These references to Actors are defined in Section 18.17, “Common Data Model: Actor”. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org/\", \"@type\": \"CreativeWork\", \"copyrightHolder\": { \"name\": \"BBC\", \"legalName\": \"British Broadcasting Corporation\", \"identifier\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/\", \"credential\": [ { \"url\": \"self#jumbf=c2pa/urn:uuid:F9168C5E-CEB2-4faa-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4/c2pa.credentials/https://www.bbc.co.uk/\", \"alg\": \"sha256\", \"hash\": \"Auxjtmax46cC2N3Y9aFmBO9Jfay8LEwJWzBUtZ0sUM8gA\" } ] }, \"copyrightYear\": 2021, \"copyrightNotice\": \"Copyright © 2021 BBC.\" } In most W3C Verifiable Credential workflows, the information about the subject (e.g., the cryptographic keys) is fetched on demand at the time of validation. While that is an acceptable model, it does open up a possible attack vector by providing an attacker with an externally-visible signal about what the validator is validating. Therefore, C2PA also supports having the information captured and embedded at the time of signature. This not only prevents leakage, but also makes it very clear what data the signer is asserting about the credential’s subject. Since a W3C Verifiable Credential can contain personally identifiable information, there may be workflows where it is necessary to remove/redact a W3C Verifiable Credential from the VCStore. To redact a W3C Verifiable Credential, a claim generator shall overwrite the contents of the credential in the W3C Credential Store with all zeroes, just as one would when redacting an assertion, however, doing only that will cause validation failures later on since the hashed_uri to the W3C Verifiable Credential will fail to resolve causing a validation failure. To fully redact a W3C Verifiable Credential, the associated (referencing) assertion would also need to be redacted. A key aspect to the standard C2PA manifest is the presence of one or more data structures, called content bindings, that can uniquely identify portions of the asset. There are two types of bindings that are supported by C2PA - hard bindings and soft bindings. A hard binding (also known as a cryptographic binding) enables the validator to ensure that (a) this manifest belongs with this asset and (b) that the asset has not been modified, by determining values that can match only this asset and no other, not even other assets derived from it or renditions produced from it. A soft binding is computed from the digital content of an asset, rather than its raw bits. A soft binding is useful for identifying derived assets and asset renditions. A single manifest shall not contain more than one assertion defining a hard binding. The simplest type of hard binding that can be used to detect tampering is a cryptographic hashing algorithm, as described in Section 13.1, “Hashing”, over some or all of the bytes of an asset. This approach can be used on any type of asset. When using this form of hard binding, one or more data hash assertions is used to define the range of bytes that are hashed (and those that are not). Because each data hash assertion defines a byte range and optional URL, it is flexible enough to be usable whether the asset is a single binary or represented in multiple chunks or portions, local or remote. If the asset is based on ISO BMFF then a hard binding optimized for the box-based format (called BMFF-based hash assertions) may be used instead. For a monolithic MP4 file asset where the mdat box is validated as a unit, the assertion is validated nearly identically to a data hash assertion. It simply uses a box exclusion list instead of byte ranges to define the range of bytes that are hashed (and those that are not). For a monolithic MP4 file asset where the mdat box is validated piecemeal or an asset composed of fragmented MP4 (fMP4) files, the assertion itself must be combined with chunk-specific hashing information which is located as specified in Section 11.3.2, “Embedding manifests into BMFF-based assets”. Validating a given chunk requires first validating the merkle field’s initHash over the corresponding initialization segment and then locating the correct entry in the merkle field’s hashes array and validating it against the hash of the chunk’s data plus (if needed) deriving the hash using the other hashes specified in the chunk’s C2PA-specific box. Figure 5. Validating the initialization segment Figure 6. Validating the chunk’s data In those workflows which embed asset metadata into the asset, such asset metadata should not be excluded by data hash assertions. This means that by default all asset metadata (including Exif metadata and IPTC metadata in either IPTC-IIM or XMP format) will be included in the data hash assertions, but with no provenance information such as who made the claims. To explicitly assert the same claims in a C2PA assertion with verifiable provenance, the Exif or IPTC fields should be copied to a stds.exif or stds.iptc.photo-metadata assertion, as appropriate (see Section 18.14, “Exif Information” and Section 18.15, “IPTC Photo Metadata”). We recommend that existing Exif, IPTC-IIM and/or XMP asset metadata be left untouched in the asset. This will allow for compatibility with tools which do not yet support C2PA metadata. Soft bindings are described using soft binding assertions such as via a perceptual hash computed from the digital content or a watermark embedded within the digital content. These soft bindings enable digital content to be matched even if the underlying bits differ, for example due to an asset rendition in a different resolution or encoding format. Additionally, should a C2PA manifest be removed from an asset, but a copy of that manifest remains in a provenance store elsewhere, the manifest and asset may be matched using available soft bindings. Because they serve a different purpose, a soft binding shall not be used as a hard binding. All soft bindings shall be generated using one of the algorithms listed as supported by this specification. This section is intended to provide: A list of algorithms that are allowed for generating soft bindings of new content as well as required for validating or locating existing content (the allowed list), and A list of algorithms that are required to be supported for validating or locating existing content but are not allowed for generating soft bindings of new content (the deprecated list). There are no soft binding algorithms defined in the approved list nor in the deprecated list in this version of the specification. The C2PA is currently evaluating various soft binding algorithms. One of the many possible options includes the ISCC - International Standard Content Code. The ISCC is an identifier and fingerprint for digital assets that supports all major content types (e.g., text, image, audio, video). The ISCC uses is similarity-preserving hashes generated both from metadata and content. This list of allowed algorithms will define the string algorithm identifier to be used as the algorithm identifier in the corresponding field and the content types over which it is applicable. In cases where there are different versions of an algorithm, each will be defined using different string algorithm identifiers. Any technical documentation sufficient for the soft binding algorithm to be uniquely identified and utilized, should be referenced. Each algorithm should be defined along with the names and values of all parameters affecting the operation of that algorithm. When doing so, it shall describe the manner in which those parameters must be encoded within the alg-params field of the soft binding assertion. An algorithm that is instantiated over a different parameter set will be considered a different algorithm. Each algorithm may also define an encoding scheme for specifying the portion of digital content over which a soft binding is computed (namely, the extent field of the scope object within the soft binding assertion). An algorithm that encodes the extent differently will be considered a different algorithm. It is recommended that the string identifiers for soft binding algorithms conform to how they are referred to in common practice. A claim gathers together all the assertions about an asset from an actor at a given time including the set of assertions for binding to the content. The claim is then cryptographically hashed and signed as described in Section 10.3.2.4, “Signing a Claim”. A claim has all the same properties as an assertion including being assigned the label (c2pa.claim) and supporting the use of assertion metadata. The CDDL Definition for this type is: ; CDDL schema for a claim map in C2PA claim-map = { \"claim_generator\": tstr, ; A User-Agent string formatted as per http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.5.3, for including the name and version of the claims generator that created the claim \"claim_generator_info\": [1* generator-info-map], \"signature\": jumbf-uri-type, ; JUMBF URI reference to the signature of this claim \"assertions\": [1* $hashed-uri-map], \"dc:format\": tstr, ; media type of the asset \"instanceID\": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; uniquely identifies a specific version of an asset ? \"dc:title\": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; name of the asset, ? \"redacted_assertions\": [1* jumbf-uri-type], ; List of hashed URI references to the assertions of ingredient manifests being redacted ? \"alg\": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the cryptographic hash algorithm used to compute all data hash assertions listed in this claim unless otherwise overridden, taken from the C2PA data hash algorithm identifier registry.

If present, the value of dc:title shall be a human-readable name for the asset. If the asset contains XMP, then the asset’s xmpMM:InstanceID should be used as the instanceID. When no XMP is available, then some other unique identifier for the asset shall be used as the value for instanceID. Some field names, such as dc:format, have namespace prefixes as their names and definitions are taken directly from the XMP standard. However, their usage in C2PA does not require the use of XMP. The signature field shall be present containing a URI reference to a claim signature. The assertions field shall be present containing one or more URI references to the assertions being made by this claim. When present, the redacted_assertions field shall contain one or more URI references to redacted assertions. The claim_generator field is required and its value is a string that conforms to the User-Agent string format specified in section 5.5.3 of HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content to inform a manifest consumer about what software/hardware/system produced this Claim. Since the User-Agent string uses spaces to separate tokens, it is recommended to use an _ (underscore, U+005F) to combine words inside a single token (e.g., \"Joe’s Editor\" → \"Joe’s_Editor\"). More detailed information about the claim generator shall be present as the value of claim_generator_info. For compatibility with version 1.0 of this standard, both claim_generator and claim_generator_info are required to be present. A Manifest Consumer shall use the value of claim_generator_info in determining information about the claim generator for itself or for presentation in a UX. If only a claim_generator field is present, or both claim_generator and claim_generator_hints are present, the Manifest Consumer shall consider this a 1.0-compliant claim. In that case, it shall use the value of claim_generator, as is, for presentation in a UX. In previous versions of this specification, there existed a claim_generator_hints object which allowed using the specific fields from W3C’s proposed User Agent Client Hints specification. However, the W3C chose to take that specification in a direction that is not aligned with C2PA and so that structure is no longer written into claims. When adding a claim_generator_info field, its value is an array of at least one generator-info-map object. Each object shall contain at least the name field and may optionally contain a version field and an icon field, though any other field is permitted, using the standard entity-specific labels' format described in Section 6.2, “Labels”. The first entry of the array shall represent the hardware/software that actually created the claim (aka the claim generator itself), while other entries may represent other hardware, software or libraries involved in the process in decreasing order of significance. A claim generator may desire to provide a graphical representation of itself, referred here as an icon, to a manifest consumer that is presenting a user experience. The value of the icon object, if present, shall be a hashed URI. As with the assertions array, the hash algorithm used for a hashed URI is determined by the alg field present in the hashed URI, or when absent, by a hash field in the claim. Example using claim generator info { \"claim_generator\": \"Joe's_Photo_Editor/2.0 (Windows 10)\", \"claim_generator_info\" : [ { \"name\": \"Joe's Photo Editor\", \"version\": \"2.0\", \"schema.org.SoftwareApplication.operatingSystem\": \"Windows 10\", \"icon\": { \"url\": \"http://cdn.examplephotoagency.com/logo.svg\", \"hash\": \"5bdec8169b4e4484b79aba44cee5c6bd\" } }, { \"name\": \"Some C2PA SDK\", \"version\": \"1.5\", \"com.litware.url\" : \"https://www.litware.com/SDK\" } ] } Before the claim can be finalized, all assertions must be created and stored in a newly created C2PA Assertion Store as described later in this document. When creating a standard manifest, it may not be possible to know all of the required binding information at the time of claim creation, in which case use the multiple step processing method to setup and then later fill-in the information. The claim shall contain the assertions field and its value is a list of all of the URI references for all assertions that were added to the assertion store that are being \"claimed\" by this claim. At least one of the assertions shall be either a data hash assertion or a BMFF-based hash assertion. If any assertions in ingredient claims are being redacted, their URI references shall be added to list which is the value of the redacted_assertions field. In many authoring scenarios, an actor does not create an entirely new asset but instead brings in other existing assets on which to create their work - either as a derived asset, a composed asset or an asset rendition. These existing assets are called ingredients and their use is documented in the provenance data through the use of an ingredient assertion. When an ingredient contains one or more C2PA manifests, those manifests must be inserted into this asset’s manifest store to ensure that the provenance data is kept intact. Such ingredient manifests are added to the JUMBF as described in Section 11.1.1, “C2PA Box details”. The signature cannot be part of the signed payload, but since its label is pre-defined, then the full URI reference is also known. As such, we can include that in the claim by setting the value of the signature field of the claim to that URI reference. This provides the explicit binding of the claim to its signature. Producing the signature is specified in Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures”. The payload field of Sig_structure shall be the serialized CBOR of the claim document, and shall use detached content mode. The serialized COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure resulting from the digital signature procedure is written into the C2PA Claim Signature box. If possible, the signer should use a RFC3161-compliant Time Stamp Authority (TSA) (RFC 3161 section 1) to obtain a trusted time-stamp proving that the signature itself actually existed at a certain date and time and incorporate that into the COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure as a countersignature. A manifest may contain multiple time-stamps. Signers are encouraged to obtain and include time-stamps to ensure their manifests will remain valid. As described in Chapter 15, Validation, manifests without time-stamps cease to be valid when the signing credential expires or becomes revoked. All time-stamps shall be obtained as described in RFC3161 with the following additional requirements: The MessageImprint of the TimeStampReq structure (RFC 3161 section 2.4.1) shall be computed by creating the ToBeSigned value in RFC 8152 section 4.4 with the following values for elements of Sig_structure: The context element shall be CounterSignature. The payload element shall be as described in Section 10.3.2.4, “Signing a Claim”. The remaining elements of Sig_structure are as described in Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures”. The ToBeSigned value is then hashed using a hash algorithm from the allowed list in Section 13.1, “Hashing” that the TSA supports, and that hash algorithm and value are placed in the MessageImprint. If the TSA does not support any hash algorithms from the allowed list, it cannot be used for time-stamping. Where possible, the hash algorithm should use the same hash algorithm used in the digital signature of the claim. The certReq boolean of the TimeStampReq structure shall be asserted in the request to the TSA, to ensure its certificate chain is provided in the response. Time-stamps shall be stored in a COSE unprotected header whose label is the string sigTst. If no time-stamps are included, the header shall be absent. When present, the value of this header shall be a tstContainer defined by the following CDDL: ; CBOR version of tstContainer and related structures based on JSON schema at https://forge.etsi.org/rep/esi/x19_182_JAdES/raw/v1.1.1/19182-jsonSchema.json tstContainer = { \"tstTokens\": [1* tstToken] } tstToken = { \"val\": bstr } The content of the TimeStampResp structure received in reply from the TSA shall be stored as the value of the val property of an element of tstTokens. The above definition is a CBOR adaptation of a subset of the schema from JAdES section 5.3.4 and its JSON schema, except with the modification that the content of val is a byte string containing the content of the TimeStampResp, and not a Base64-encoded version of the same. If the signer’s credential type supports querying its online credential status, and the credential contains a pointer to a service to provide time-stamped credential status information, the signer should query the service, capture the response, and store it in the manner described for the signer’s credential type in the Trust Model. If credential revocation information is attached in this manner, a trusted time-stamp must also be obtained after signing, as described in Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps”. Here is a visual representation of an image containing a single claim with multiple assertions that have been embedded inside it. Figure 7. A single claim with assertions In this example of creating a second claim for the previous example, one of the original assertions has been redacted from the previous claim. The visual representation for this scenario would look like: Figure 8. Redacting assertions in a secondary claim Some asset file formats require file offsets of the C2PA Manifest Store and asset content to be fixed before the manifest is signed, so that content bindings will correctly align with the content they authenticate. Unfortunately, the size of a manifest and its signature cannot be precisely known until after signing, which could cause file offsets to change. For example, in JPEG-1 files, the entire C2PA Manifest Store must appear in the file before the image data, and so its size will affect the file offsets of content being authenticated. To accomplish this, a multiple step approach is taken, similar to how signatures in PDF are done. For those C2PA-enabled assets that contain embedded XMP, start by creating the XMP data stream and then serializing it into the asset in the standard location reserved for it in the format of the asset. The XMP stream may include the active manifest reference. While it is possible to add the XMP data to the list of exclusions in a data hash assertion, doing so is not recommended as it would remove tamper detection of that asset metadata. When creating a standard manifest, its claim shall include one or more content binding assertions in its list of assertions to ensure that the asset is tamper-evident. Create the data hash assertion and add it to the assertion store taking into account the following considerations. In many cases, such as with JPEG-1, it is not possible to hash the asset in its entirety because the manifest will be embedded in the middle of the file, so the size or location manifest data will not be known at the time the asset hash is calculated. This circular dependency is avoided by allowing exclusion ranges to be specified during hashing. When exclusion ranges are specified, a single hash is performed, but only over the asset ranges that are not in any of the exclusions. If a manifest is embedded in the center of a JPEG-1 file in an APP11 segment, then the claim creator may exclude the APP11 segment(s) from the hash calculation. In order to prevent insertion attacks, it is desirable to have only a single exclusion range when possible. When the size or location (or both) of the manifest in the asset is not known, then the start and length values in the data hash assertion shall both be zero and the size of the pad value should be large enough to accommodate writing in the values in the second pass. At least 16 bytes is recommended. The value of the pad key shall consist of all 0x00’s. Add the newly created data hash assertion reference to the claim’s assertion list providing a temporary hash value, such as empty spaces. At this point, the temporary claim is complete and can be added to the C2PA Manifest being created. Since the claim is only temporary at this time, it is not possible to sign it. To ensure the claim signature box contains a valid CBOR structure, create a temporary COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure as described in RFC 8152 section 4.2. The COSE_Sign1_Tagged is a tag byte followed by a COSE_Sign1 structure, which is a four-element CBOR array. Construct the array as follows: The first element is the protected header bucket (RFC 8152 section 3). Create an empty bucket by placing a bstr of size 0 in this position. The second element is the unprotected header bucket, which is a CBOR map. Create a map of 1 pair. Use the string pad as the label, and place a bstr of the desired padding size filled with zero bytes (0x00) as the value. A 25 kilobyte size is recommended for the initial size of this padding. The third element is the payload. Place the value nil (CBOR major type 7, value 22) here. The fourth element is signature. Place a bstr of size 0 here. At this point all of the boxes that comprise the entire C2PA Manifest for the asset are completed and can be (if not already) constructed into its final form. The asset’s C2PA Manifest, along with the manifests of any ingredients, are combined together to form the complete C2PA Manifest Store. The active manifest must be the last C2PA Manifest superbox in the C2PA Manifest Store superbox. The C2PA Manifest Store can then be embedded into the asset as discussed in Section 11.3, “Embedding manifests into assets”. Now that the C2PA Manifest Store has been embedded into the asset, the starting offset and the length of the active manifest can be updated in its data hash assertion. It is necessary that when doing so, you do not change the size of the assertion’s box, only its data. This is done by adjusting the value of the pad field to be the necessary length to \"fill up\" the remaining bytes. Preferred/deterministic CBOR serialization of pad uses a variable length integer to specify the length of the encoded binary data. When the length goes from zero to 1 byte, or 1 to 2 bytes (etc.), the length of the resulting pad jumps by two bytes. This means that not all paddings can be expressed using a single padding field. For example, 24-byte and 26-byte pads can be created, but a 25-byte pad cannot. If this situation arises, the desired padding can be split between pad and pad2. For example, to make a 25-byte pad, a claim generator can encode 19 bytes into pad (resulting in an encoded length of 20 bytes), and 4 bytes into pad2 (resulting in 5 bytes.) Once the data hash assertion has been updated, it can be hashed and the hash written over the empty spaces that were used previously to hold the location. The claim is now complete, and it can be hashed and signed as described in Section 10.3.2.4, “Signing a Claim”, with the resultant signature filling the pre-allocated space. The pad header can then be shrunk as required so that the claim signature box remains the same size; because this header is unprotected, changing it does not invalidate the claim signature. If the serialized COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure exceeds the reserved size of the C2PA Claim Signature box, multiple step processing must be repeated with a larger padding size chosen in Section 10.4.3, “Create a temporary Claim and Signature”. Revocation information retrieved during the previous attempt should be reusable if it is still within its validity interval (RFC 6960 section 4.2.2.1), but a new time-stamp will be required on the new claim with the file offsets changed as the result of added padding. In order to support many of the requirements of C2PA, C2PA Manifests needed to be stored (serialized) into a structured binary data store that enables some specific functionality including: Ability to store multiple manifests (e.g., parents and ingredients) in a single container Ability to refer to individual elements (both within and across manifests) via URIs Ability to clearly identify the parts of an element to be hashed Ability to store pre-defined data types used by C2PA (e.g., JSON and CBOR) Ability to store arbitrary data formats (e.g., XML, JPEG, etc.) In addition to supporting all of the requirements above, our chosen container format - JUMBF, ISO 19566-5 - is also natively supported by the JPEG family of formats and is compatible with the box-based model (i.e., ISOBMFF, ISO 14496-12) used by many common image and video file formats. Using JUMBF enables all the same benefits (and a few extras, such as URI References) while being able to work with classic image formats, such as JPEG/JFIF and PNG as well as 3D and document (e.g., PDF) formats. This serialized format shall be used also in formats that do not natively support JUMBF, or when C2PA Manifest Stores are stored separately from the asset, such as in a separate file or URI location. Since most of the standard assertions, as well the claim signature, are serialized as CBOR, using CBOR for the entire C2PA Manifest was considered but not chosen because CBOR is not a container format. It could be used as one through having to re-define how CBOR would be used to provide the features natively supported by JUMBF. For example, to store a \"blob of JSON\" inside of CBOR, and know that it is JSON (and not some other format) would require designing a data structure for storing such things. Then the parent structure would need to be defined as to how to carry that structure. This same concept would also have to be done for each of the native features of JUMBF. While it would certainly be possible to re-implement all of the required functionality entirely in CBOR, it would be a lot of work and would not fully remove the need for a JUMBF/BMFF parser in all implementations. A C2PA Manifest Consumer shall never process an assertion, assertion store, claim, claim signature or C2PA Manifest that is not contained inside of a C2PA Manifest Store. Additionally, when a C2PA Manifest Consumer encounters a JUMBF box or superbox whose UUID it does not recognize, it shall skip over (and ignore) its contents. This means that the C2PA Manifest Consumer can process private boxes that it knows about, but ignore ones of which it is unaware. C2PA data is serialized into a JUMBF-compatible box structure, and the outermost box is referred to as the C2PA Manifest Store. An example C2PA Manifest Store, with a single C2PA Manifest, might look like this: Figure 9. C2PA Manifest Store The C2PA Manifest Store is a JUMBF superbox composed of a series of other JUMBF boxes and superboxes, each identified by their own UUID and label in their JUMBF Description box. The C2PA Manifest Store shall have a label of c2pa, a UUID of 0x63327061-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2pa) and shall contain one or more C2PA manifest superboxes, also known as C2PA Manifests. The C2PA Manifest Store may also contain JUMBF superboxes whose UUIDs are not defined in this specification. Allowing other superboxes enables custom extensions to C2PA as well as enabling the addition of new boxes in future versions of this specification without breaking compatibility. Each C2PA Manifest shall contain the data created at the time a claim is issued including the C2PA Assertion Store, a C2PA Claim, and a C2PA Claim Signature. It may also contain a C2PA Credential Store. A C2PA Manifest may also contain JUMBF superboxes whose UUIDs are not defined in this specification. The UUID for each C2PA Manifest shall be either 0x63326D61-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2ma) or 0x6332756D-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2um) depending on the type of manifest. In order to enable uniquely identifying each C2PA Manifest, they shall be labelled with a RFC 4122, UUID optionally proceeded by an identifier of the claim generator and a :. An example label for the fictitious ACME claim generator might look like acme:urn:uuid:F9168C5E-CEB2-4FAA-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4. The C2PA Assertion Store is a superbox that shall have a label of c2pa.assertions and a UUID of 0x63326173-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2as). It shall contain one or more JUMBF superboxes (called C2PA Assertion boxes) whose JUMBF type defines the BMFF type of the sub-boxes that contain the assertion data (see ISO 19566-5, Annex B, Table B.1 and ISO 19566-5/AMD-1, Annex B). These superboxes shall each have a label as defined in Standard Assertions. The JUMBF Content Type (ISO 19566-5, Annex B) box(es) contained in each assertion superbox should be CBOR Content Type (cbor), JSON Content Type (json), Embedded File Content Type (bfdb & bidb) or UUID Content Type (uuid) though any Content Type defined in JUMBF and its amendments is permitted. The C2PA Assertion Store shall not contain any JUMBF boxes or superboxes that are not JUMBF Content Boxes. Custom assertions containing other formats/serializations of data, such as encrypted data, are supported through the use of a UUID Content Box containing the custom UUID followed by the data (see ISO 19566-5, B.5). The C2PA Claim box shall have a label of c2pa.claim, a UUID of 0x6332636C-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2cl) and shall consist of a single CBOR Content Type box (cbor). The C2PA Claim Signature box shall have a label of c2pa.signature, a UUID of 0x63326373-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2cs) and shall consist of a single CBOR Content Type box (cbor). A C2PA Credential Store (VCStore) is a JUMBF superbox that shall contain only one or more JSON Content Type boxes (ISO 19566-5, Annex B.4). It shall not contain any other type of JUMBF box or superbox. It shall have a label of c2pa.credentials and a UUID of 0x63327663-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2vc). When storing W3C Verifiable Credentials in a VCStore, each one shall be labelled with the value of the id field of the credentialSubject of the VC itself. Since the id is guaranteed to be unique, this ensures that the URI to that credential will be unique. Figure 10. C2PA Manifest Store with W3C Verifiable Credentials When a C2PA Manifest includes ingredient assertions, and an ingredient contains a C2PA Manifest, that manifest shall be brought into this asset to ensure that the provenance data is kept intact. Such ingredient manifests are added to the C2PA Manifest Store as a peer of the C2PA Manifest for the asset itself. Figure 11. C2PA Manifest Store With an Ingredient All C2PA Manifests shall contain an assertion store with at least one assertion, a claim and a claim signature. It may also contain a credential store. A standard C2PA Manifest (UUID: 0x63326D61-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2ma)) shall contain exactly one hard binding to content assertion - either a c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.bmff (deprecated), or c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 based on the type of asset and version for which the manifest is destined. Because of this requirement, they are the predominant type of manifest that will be present in C2PA provenance data. There are, however, provenance workflows where additional assertions need to be added but the digital content is not changed. In these workflows, an Update Manifest (UUID: 0x6332756D-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2um)) can be used. An Update Manifest shall not contain assertions of types c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.bmff, or c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 because the content has not changed and therefore the bindings need not be updated. If the hashes cover other types of potentially updatable information, such as XMP or IPTC metadata areas in the format, they too cannot be modified. In the case of a file offset hash (c2pa.hash.data), the C2PA Manifest Store has to continue to start at the same file offset after updating - only its length can change. The Update Manifest shall not contain an assertion of type c2pa.actions because that assertion is defined to describe \"changes to the digital content\". It shall not contain a Thumbnail assertion as that would imply changes to the content as well. The Update Manifest shall contain exactly one c2pa.ingredient assertion that (a) includes a c2pa_manifest field with a value that is the URI reference to that C2PA Manifest that is being updated and (b) has the value of parentOf for the relationship field. The ingredient’s C2PA Manifest (referenced via the c2pa_manifest field) can be either a standard manifest or an update manifest. A C2PA Manifest is embedded into an asset as part of the C2PA Manifest Store for that asset. When embedding the C2PA Manifest Store into an asset, the location will vary based on the type of the asset. Here are some well-known types and the location to use: JPEG Refer to Section 11.3.1.1, “Embedding manifests into JPEG” for more information. PNG Refer to Section 11.3.1.2, “Embedding manifests into PNG” for more information. SVG Refer to Section 11.3.1.3, “Embedding manifests into SVG” for more information. PDF Refer to Section 11.3.1.4, “Embedding manifests into PDFs” for more information. FLAC Refer to Section 11.3.1.5, “Embedding manifests into ID3” for more information. EDITORS NOTE C2PA is asking for feedback from the audio community if embedding the C2PA Manifest Store in an ID3v2 container will work with FLAC or if we will need to use the native FLAC container. MP3 Refer to Section 11.3.1.5, “Embedding manifests into ID3” for more information. BMFF-based formats The box specified in Section 11.3.2, “Embedding manifests into BMFF-based assets”. A C2PA Manifest Store can be embedded in BMFF-based downloadable audio files using codecs such as the Advanced Audio Codec (AAC) or the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC). Additional locations for other file formats will be added in the future. Non-BMFF-based audio formats which are being considered for addition to this specification include MP3, Ogg Vorbis and the native container version of the Free Lossless Audio Codec (Native FLAC). Many classic image formats such as GIF and BMP do not support the embedding of arbitrary data, so that the use of an external manifest is required. The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded as the data contained in an APP11 Marker as defined in JPEG XT, ISO/IEC 18477-3. Since a single marker segment in JPEG-1 cannot be larger than 64K bytes, it is likely that multiple APP11 segments will be required, and they shall be constructed as per the JPEG-1 standard and ISO 19566-5, D.2. When writing multiple segments, they shall be written in sequential order, and they shall be contiguous (i.e., one segment immediately following the next). The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded using an ancillary, private, not safe to copy, chunk type of 'caBX' (as per PNG, 4.7.2). It is recommended that the 'caBX' chuck precede the 'IDAT' chunks. Although PNG supports it, it’s considered bad-form to have a data block after the 'IDAT' and before the 'IEND'. (The exception being animated PNG blocks) SVG is an XML-based format that can exist either stand-alone or embedded into other text-based formats such as HTML. As such, it is necessary to Base64 encode the binary C2PA Manifest Store to perform the embedding. While this section describes how to do that, the use of an external manifest is preferred. The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded as the Base64-encoded value of a c2pa:manifest element in the metadata element of the SVG. An example might look like this (with the actual C2PA Manifest’s data left out) ...Base64 data goes here... The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded using an embedded file specification (ISO 32000, 7.11.3). The file specification dictionary shall have an AFRelationship key whose value is C2PA_Manifest. If the C2PA Manifest Store is embedded into an encrypted PDF, the embedded file stream shall use an Identity crypt filter. The embedded file specification shall be the value (via indirect object) of the AF key in the document catalog dictionary. It shall also be referenced (via indirect object) either from the EmbeddedFiles NameTree (/Catalog/Names/EmbeddedFiles) or from a FileAttachment annotation. The annotation approach shall be used when adding a C2PA Manifest Store to a PDF that already has an existing PDF signature in order to avoid invalidating its DocMDP restrictions. It is possible to add a PDF signature (certifying or approval) to a PDF following the inclusion of a C2PA Manifest Store, but only if the addition is known at the time of the creation of the active manifest. Since the PDF signature will change the contents of the PDF after the C2PA Manifest is signed, the size and location of value of its Contents key must be determined before C2PA signing and added to the list of exclusions in the data.hash assertion, so that the C2PA signature is not invalidated by the addition of the PDF signature. Adding the PDF signature in addition to the C2PA’s claim signature improves compatibility with the existing PDF ecosystem. The C2PA Manifest Store shall be embedded into a ID3v2-compatible, compressed audio file (e.g., MP3 or FLAC) file as the Encapsulated object data of a General Encapsulated Object (GEOB) as defined in https://id3.org/id3v2.3.0#General_encapsulated_object. The GEOB’s MIME type field shall be present and shall use the value for the media type for JUMBF as described in Section 11.4, “External Manifests”. All BMFF-based C2PA assets, whether they are timed (e.g., videos with or without audio tracks), untimed (e.g., still photos) or mixed (e.g., live or animated photos) audiovisual media, shall use a 'uuid' box that adheres to the following syntax and semantics defined below. EDITORS NOTE The reason that a 'uuid' box instead of a 'c2pa' box is being used is that browsers based on Chromium will immediately fail playback when they encounter any unknown top-level boxes. Some file formats that are BMFF-based and would be supported via this method include: MPEG-4 code-points, either complete (.mp4) or fragmented (.m4s); downloadable audio files (.m4a) HEIF (.heif, .heic) AVIF (.avif) Box Type: `'uuid'` Extended Box Type: 0xD8, 0xFE, 0xC3, 0xD6, 0x1B, 0x0E, 0x48, 0x3C, 0x92, 0x97, 0x58, 0x28, 0x87, 0x7E, 0xC4, 0x81 Container: File Mandatory: No Quantity: Zero or more The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity ('uuid' with aforementioned uuid) box embeds provenance into BMFF. One such box contains a C2PA Manifest Store, and there may be one or more auxiliary boxes containing additional information required for validation. aligned(8) class ContentProvenanceBox extends FullBox(`'uuid'`, extended_type = 0xD8 0xFE 0xC3 0xD6 0x1B 0x0E 0x48 0x3C 0x92 0x97 0x58 0x28 0x87 0x7E 0xC4 0x81, version = 0, 0) { string box_purpose; bit(8) data[]; } box_purpose [indicates purpose of box] data [depends on box_purpose] The box_purpose and fields that depend on it are described below for each box purpose. Regarding unique ids: There are cases, such as fragmented MP4 (fMP4), where the id for a subset of the asset, such as the track_id field of the 'tkhd' box, is only locally unique to a subset of the overall asset rather than globally unique to the asset. Because a globally unique id is required to determine what to hash, a unique id is included. This unique id does not equal any value from the original asset; each value is instead defined when the manifest is created. The unique id is then combined with an associated local id to form an id that’s globally unique to the entire asset. The box containing the C2PA Manifest Store shall appear before the first 'mdat' box in the file and before any 'moov' box in the file. To accommodate major_brand and compatible_brand verification, it shall be placed after the 'ftyp' box. The fields in the corresponding box described above shall be set as follows. box_purpose For a C2PA Manifest Store, this value shall be manifest. data When box_purpose is manifest, the first 8 bytes inside 'data' shall be the absolute file byte offset to the first auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box with box_purpose equal to merkle. If this file contains no such boxes, those 8 bytes shall be zero. Those 8 bytes shall be followed by the raw C2PA Manifest Store bytes followed by zero or more unused padding bytes. The 'data' field inside the 'uuid' box of type manifest includes the absolute file byte offset, manifest, and padding bytes. Padding bytes are NOT permitted OUTSIDE the 'uuid' box unless they are contained in their own mp4 box such as a 'free' box. For fragmented MP4 (fMP4) files, an identical 'uuid' C2PA box of type manifest shall be present in each initialization segment; the C2PA Manifest Store shall be identical. Some files have one or more very large 'mdat' boxes (e.g., large video or image files which may be downloaded and rendered progressively) or large numbers of independent 'mdat' boxes (e.g., fMP4 where each fragment can be downloaded independently). In these cases, it is unreasonable to require a client to completely download all 'mdat' box(es) before validating any portion of the asset. Avoiding that necessity is resolved by using multiple hashes. For each large 'mdat' box, subsets of the box have individual hashes that can be validated independently; how to determine these subsets is specified below. For fMP4 content where each 'mdat' box can be downloaded independently, each fragment has its own individual hash. In the simplest case, all of these hashes are stored in the active manifest. Each subset has an auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box that declares how to locate its hash in the active manifest; refer to the note regarding unique ids above for why this is the case. However, for sufficiently large assets, including every subset’s hash in the manifest itself would increase the size of the C2PA Manifest Store to one or more megabytes. Avoiding such a large C2PA Manifest Store for a large asset is achieved by using one or more Merkle trees. For a large non-fragmented asset that contains one or more 'mdat' boxes in a single large file, one Merkle tree is used for each 'mdat' box. For a large fragmented asset that contains a set of 'mdat' boxes for a single track which may be spread across multiple files, one Merkle tree is used for each track. In either case: Each leaf node of any given Merkle tree is the subset’s hash. The manifest stores one row of each Merkle tree. The auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box that exists for each subset indicates which Merkle tree row in the active manifest it requires and which leaf node it represents. It also includes any additional hash(es) from the Merkle tree necessary to derive a hash in the active manifest’s Merkle tree row. The selection of which Merkle tree row to store in the manifest creates a size tradeoff within the asset. Specifically, storing a single hash per Merkle tree in the manifest minimizes the size of the manifest but requires log2(subsets) to be stored in each subset-specific box. Each time the number of hashes stored in the manifest for a Merkle tree is doubled (by moving \"down\" one Merkle tree row), the number of hashes stored in each subset-specific box decreases by one. Thus, increasing the size of the manifest decreases the size of the entire asset and vice-versa, and since hashes for individual subsets are replicated across subsets as required to derive a manifest-specified hash, the tradeoff is not 1 to 1. Making this size tradeoff is left up to the implementation creating the manifest; this spec neither mandates nor recommends that any specific Merkle tree row be stored in the manifest. That said, because the simplest case of storing all subset hashes in the manifest is equivalent to using a Merkle tree where the leaf nodes are stored in the manifest, the same Merkle tree construction is used for multiple hashes in all cases. That construction is defined as follows. The portion of the manifest containing the BMFF Hash shall include the merkle field. Refer to Section 9.2.2, “Hashing a BMFF-formatted asset” for more information. For large 'mdat' boxes that can be validated piecemeal, two or more auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes with box_purpose set to 'merkle' as described below shall be included in the single asset file. They shall follow the last 'mdat' box in the file. For timed-media where an 'stco' or 'co64' box is present, the hash used for a given leaf node in the Merkle tree shall be computed over an individual subset of samples as defined by that box. For untimed-media where an 'iloc' box is present (such as HEIF or AVIF), the hash used for a given leaf node in the Merkle tree shall be computed over an individual item as defined by that box. Regardless of the subset-defining mechanism, all such auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes shall occur in the same sequence as the subsets they hash as specified by the 'stco', 'co64', or 'iloc' box regardless of their location in the 'mdat'. They shall also be grouped such that a single Merkle tree’s auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes are sequential with no intervening boxes. EDITORS NOTE Are there other scenarios where an 'mdat' can be large enough to be worth dividing where neither 'stco', 'co64', nor 'iloc' is present? If so, what box(es) should be used to decide on subset division points? For fMP4 assets which are split across multiple files: One auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box with box_purpose set to 'merkle' as described below shall be included in each fragment file immediately preceding the 'moof' box. The hash used for a given leaf node in the Merkle tree shall be over all data in its containing single fragment file except data excluded by the exclusion list. This specification does not enable support for fMP4 assets which are split across multiple files where individual fragment files contain more than one 'moof' box and/or 'mdat' box. For fMP4 assets which are stored as a single flat MP4 file with a single 'moov' for all tracks and then one 'moof'/'mdat' pair for each fragment: One auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box with box_purpose set to 'merkle' as described below shall be included immediately preceding each 'moof' box. The hash used for a given leaf node in the Merkle tree shall be over that 'moof' box plus all data preceding the next 'moof' box or over all data through the end of the file if there is no further 'moof' box. The hash shall not cover data excluded by the exclusion list. Taking a c2pa-compliant fMP4 asset which is split across multiple files (i.e., has 'c2pa' boxes of types 'manifest' and 'merkle') and appending the individual files together will not produce a single file which is 'c2pa' compliant (nor vice-versa). This is because which boxes are included in each 'merkle' hash will be different in the two cases. If both forms are desirable, the second form shall consider the first form as an ingredient and the new manifest shall include both an 'Ingredient' assertion with relationship 'parentOf' and an 'Actions' assertion that includes an action of type 'c2pa.repackaged'. Regardless of how the asset is structured, the fields in the corresponding box described above shall be set as follows. box_purpose For an auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA box, this value shall be merkle. data When box_purpose is merkle, this value shall contain raw CBOR bytes indicating how to validate a portion of the asset as defined as follows. If there are multiple auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes with box_purpose merkle for a given Merkle tree in a single file, each shall be followed by sufficient padding bytes (zero or more) to make all auxiliary 'uuid' C2PA boxes for that Merkle tree a fixed size. When there are more than one of these boxes in a single file, i.e., the case where there are large 'mdat'(s) being validated piecemeal, a fixed size is required in order to enable a progressively downloading client to only download the boxes it needs to begin validation rather than the entire Merkle tree. Such a client can download enough of the first of these boxes based on the absolute file byte offset in the active manifest to determine if its uniqueId and localId match the 'mdat' it is trying to validate. If they do, it can determine the absolute file byte offset to the box it needs to validate by multiplying the subset number by that size then download just that box. Otherwise, it can determine the absolute file byte offset to the beginning of the next Merkle tree by multiplying that fixed size by the current Merkle tree’s total number of leaf nodes, and it can repeat this process until it locates the box it needs. The total download size for this subset of boxes is very small relative to the size of a single subset. The CDDL Definition for this type is: ; The data structure used to store sufficient information to validate a single 'mdat' box or ; a portion of an 'mdat' box when a Merkle tree is used\", bmff-merkle-map = { \"uniqueId\": int, ; A unique integer used to differentiate local ids \"localId\": int, ; A local id indicating which 'mdat' box this entry pertains to. This may not be globally unique \"location\": int, ; Zero-based index into the leaf-most Merkle tree row corresponding to this 'mdat' box or portion of this 'mdat' box ? \"hashes\": [1* bstr], ; An ordered array representing the set of additional hashes required to reach a hash in the Merkle tree specified in the manifest from leaf-most (peer of this node) to root-most (child of node in manifest). Note that this array may not be present, e.g. if the manifest itself contains the leaf-most row of the Merkle tree. Null hashes are not included in this array. The algorithm used shall be determined using the `alg` field from the corresponding entry in the `merkle` field array in the BMFF hash structure. } An example in CBOR Diagnostic Format (.cbordiag) is shown below: { \"hashes\": [ b64'TWVub3JhaA==' ], \"localId\": 4402, \"location\": 2203, \"uniqueId\": 1339 } For files that use a 'tkhd' box to indicate individual tracks, the localId in the preceding CBOR shall be set to the track_id field of the 'tkhd' box pertaining to the 'mdat' being hashed. EDITORS NOTE How do we handle the case where there are multiple 'mdat' boxes for untimed media, e.g. a file that includes multiple image 'mdat' boxes? How do we handle the case where there are multiple 'mdat' boxes of different types, e.g. a file that has both audio/video 'mdat' boxes as well as an image 'mdat' box (e.g. for a thumbnail)? For scenarios such as these, a 'tkhd' box alone cannot be used to reference the complete set of different 'mdat' boxes when there are more than one; it may not be present at all. What box value(s) should be used for localId instead? Many adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) implementations store a single version of an asset, e.g., as a flat MP4 or in another intermediate format, and generate individual asset streams using various codecs, bitrates, etc. at consumption time. As a result, such a server must either hash said streams and create a C2PA Manifest each time the content is consumed or, if generation is deterministic, create and cache the hashes and C2PA Manifests once and then embed them at consumption time. This also means that such a server must have a signing identity of its own that will be trusted by validators or be able to sign the generated files on behalf of the content creator in a secure and trustworthy manner. For all c2pa.hash.bmff (deprecated) and c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 assertions, the following entries shall always appear on the exclusion list. Other entries are allowed but not required. The entire 'uuid' C2PA box shall be excluded. (The 'data' field is ensuring that other 'uuid' boxes are not excluded.) xpath = \"/uuid\" data = [ { offset = 8, data = \"2P7D1hsOSDySl1goh37EgQ==\" } ] The entire 'ftyp' and 'mfra' boxes shall be excluded. xpath = \"/ftyp\" xpath = \"/mfra\" Previous versions of this specification included additional mandatory exclusions, but it was discovered that excluding them is insecure. For all c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 assertions where the bmff-hash-map includes both the hash field and merkle fields, the following entry shall appear on the exclusion list. xpath = \"/mdat\" subset = { { 16, 0 } } As indicated in the CDDL Definition above, the c2pa.hash.bmff assertion excludes the entire 'mdat' box in this case, but it was discovered that excluding it is insecure. As indicated in the CDDL Definition above, a relative byte offset or relative byte offset plus length that exceeds the length of the box is allowed; bytes beyond the end of the box are never hashed. For example, if the mdat box is only 12 bytes long, all of it is hashed and the aforementioned mandatory exclusion entry has no effect although it is still required. Timed-media streams that are neither audio nor video, such as text streams for captions, that the claim generator wishes to make tamper evident shall be handled the same way as audio and video streams. Externally referenced content declared inside BMFF boxes, such as in a 'dref', 'url', or 'urn' box, that the claim generator wishes to make tamper evident shall not exclude the referencing box and shall include a separate cloud data assertion for each external reference to be hashed. If a BMFF-based asset uses 32-bit sizes or offsets in any box(es), e.g. the 'stco' box, and adding boxes to conform to this specification will push the file size over 4 gigabytes, it is the responsibility of the manifest creator to edit the file to use appropriate sizes and offsets, e.g. by replacing the 'stco' box with a 'co64' box, before creating the manifest. In some cases, it may not be possible (or practical) to embed a C2PA Manifest Store in an asset. In those cases, keeping the C2PA Manifests externally to the asset is an acceptable model for providing providence to assets. The manifest should be stored in a location, referred to as a manifest repository, that is easily locatable by a manifest consumer working with the asset, such as by reference or URI. As the C2PA Manifest Store is a JUMBF box, it shall be served with the JUMBF Media Type, application/x-c2pa-manifest-store. Editors Note The C2PA is in the process of formally registering the media type with IANA. Some common reasons to use an external manifest are: It may not be technically possible, such as with a .txt file. It may not be practical, such as when the size of the C2PA Manifest Store is larger than the asset’s digital content. It may not be appropriate, such as when it would modify an asset that should not be modified. NOTE: a good example of this is creating a manifest for a pre-existing asset. If the asset has embedded XMP, it is recommended that the claim generator add a dcterms:provenance key to the XMP, the value (a URI reference) being where to locate the Active Manifest. The URI shall either be a JUMBF URI for an embedded C2PA Manifest or a standard URI for any non-embedded scenarios, whether stored remotely or locally on the same storage system as the asset itself. An example JUMBF URI would be stored as: self#jumbf=c2pa/urn:uuid:F9168C5E-CEB2-4faa-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4 The following diagram provides a look at how all of the pieces of the C2PA system integrate and relate to each other. Figure 12. C2PA Entity Diagram All cryptographic hashes that are stored in a C2PA Manifest shall be generated using one of the hash algorithms as described in this section. This section defines both: A list of hash algorithms that are allowed for generating hashes of new content as well as required for validating hashes of existing content (the allowed list), and A list of hash algorithms that are required to be supported for validating hashes of existing content but are not allowed for generating hashes of new content (the deprecated list). This section does not govern algorithms used for soft bindings as described in Section 9.3, “Soft Bindings”. An algorithm must appear in no more than one list. An algorithm that is instantiated over multiple output lengths (such as the various lengths of SHA2) will each be considered different algorithms, and each instantiation must be listed separately. If an algorithm does not appear in either list, it is forbidden and must not be used or supported. Algorithms can be removed from the lists in order to implement forbidding an algorithm. For this reason, implementations must not support additional algorithms on an optional basis. Implementers should consult this section in the current version of the specification when releasing software updates and ensure their supported algorithms conform to it. These lists establish the allowed algorithms for creating hashes and a string algorithm identifier to be used as the algorithm identifier (usually called alg) in the corresponding field of C2PA data structures. The outputs of hash functions shall be stored as their binary values encoded into CBOR as byte strings (major type 2) with a declared length. Wherever a field contains the output of a hash function, an algorithm identifier string field shall be present within the same structure, or within an enclosing structure, to declare which algorithm was used. A hash algorithm identifier field should be present in exactly one of these places, but if more than one is present within the structure and its enclosing structures, the nearest identifier must be used. Nearest is defined first as an identifier that is a sibling field of the hash value, and then the immediately enclosing structure, up to the root structure. The allowed list is: SHA2-256 (\"sha256\") SHA2-384 (\"sha384\") SHA2-512 (\"sha512\") The SHA-3 family of hash algorithms are not on the allowed list for consistency with the digital signature algorithm allowed list, because COSE has not yet established digital signature algorithms that use a SHA-3 algorithm as the hash algorithm. A future version of this specification will incorporate SHA-3 for hashing as well as COSE digital signature algorithms that use SHA-3 when they are available. The deprecated list is empty. All digital signatures that are stored in a C2PA Manifest shall be generated using one of the digital signature algorithms and key types listed as described in this section. This section defines both: A list of digital signature algorithms and key types that are allowed for generating signatures of new content as well as required for validating signatures of existing content (the allowed list), and A list of digital signature algorithms and key types that are required to be supported for validating signatures of existing content but are not allowed for generating signatures of new context (the deprecated list). These lists establish the allowed algorithms and key types by referencing an algorithm identifier from the relevant standards that define algorithms for COSE and their mappings to CBOR identifiers, including but not limited to RFC 8152 and RFC 8230. These standards also specify the hash algorithm used in the signature scheme. Nothing in Section 13.1, “Hashing” shall apply to this use of hash algorithms; if a digital signature algorithm is present in the digital signature algorithm and key type registry, the use of its specified hash algorithm in the signature scheme shall be allowed and followed. Parenthetical notes in the lists below are explainers provided only as an aid to the reader. The allowed list is: ES256 (ECDSA with SHA-256) ES384 (ECDSA with SHA-384) ES512 (ECDSA with SHA-512) PS256 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256) PS384 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384) PS512 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512) EdDSA (Edwards-Curve DSA) Ed25519 instance only. No other EdDSA instances are allowed. The deprecated list is empty. Implementations must check that keys provided for signing or verification operations are correct for the chosen algorithm, as required by RFC 8152 section 8.1 for ECDSA, RFC 8152 section 8.2 for EdDSA, and RFC 8230 section 2 and section 4 for RSASSA-PSS. These requirements are summarized here for convenience: ECDSA requires elliptic curve keys on the P-256, P-384, or P-521 elliptic curves. Although it is recommended to use P-256 keys with ES256, P-384 keys with ES384, and P-521 keys with ES512, it is not required. Implementations must accept keys on any of these curves for all ECDSA algorithm choices. Ed25519 requires elliptic curve keys on the X25519 elliptic curve. RSASSA-PSS requires RSA keys with a modulus length of at least 2048 bits. Implementations must refuse to generate or verify signatures with keys that are not correct for the algorithm choice. Implementations may refuse RSA keys with modulus length greater than 16384 bits. The signature for the CBOR-encoded claim is produced by CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) as described in RFC 8152 sections 4.2 and 4.4. Payloads can either be present inside a COSE signature, or transported separately (\"detached content\" as described in RFC 8152 section 4.1). In \"detached content\" mode, the signed data is stored externally to the COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure, and the payload field of the COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure is always nil. Regardless of whether the payload will be present in or detached from the COSE_Sign1_Tagged signature; the contents of the payload field of Sig_structure in memory, when constructed to compute or verify a digital signature, must be populated with that external data as described by the particular use of digital signature in this specification. The payload field of Sig_structure shall never be nil. For example, when computing or verifying a claim signature, the payload field of the Sig_structure will contain the contents of the Claim JUMBF box, as described in Section 10.3.2.4, “Signing a Claim” and Section 11.1, “Use of JUMBF”. The signature is computed or verified as described in RFC 8152 section 4.4. The following additional requirements apply to the construction of Sig_structure: The value for the context element shall be Signature1 except where a particular use of digital signatures in this specification specifies using CounterSignature instead. Signature shall not be used. The value for the payload element will be specified by each use of digital signatures in this specification. The external_aad element shall be a bstr of length zero. External authenticated data must not be used. The alg header specifying the signature algorithm shall be present in the body_protected element. RFC 8152 section 3.1 The alg header is a standard COSE header, and therefore is always included in the protected header map with the integer 1 as its label, as established in the IANA COSE Header Parameters Registry. The literal string alg is never used as the label. The sign_protected element is always omitted when using COSE_Sign1. All digital signatures in C2PA structures shall be a COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure as defined in RFC 8152 section 4.2. COSE_Sign1_Tagged contains a COSE_Sign1 structure. The following additional requirements apply to the construction of COSE_Sign1_Tagged: The same alg header in the Sig_structure above shall be present in the protected header bucket. The value for the payload field and whether the payload is present in the signature or detached will be specified by each use of digital signatures in this specification. When the payload is specified as detached, its value here must be nil. Conversely, when the payload is present in the signature, the binary contents of the payload are stored in this field as a bstr. COSE defines nil to be major type 7, value 22 in section 1.3 and uses this value exclusively for detached content. A byte array (major type 2) of length zero cannot be used to indicate detached content. When producing a signature, if the claim generator can also act as a validator, the claim generator should validate that the signing credential is acceptable according to Chapter 14, Trust Model for the credential’s type, and produce a warning if it is not. The claim generator should still allow signing with that credential if so desired. This may be desirable if it is known the local claim generator’s validator has a different configuration than validators used by the expected audience of the asset. When verifying a signature, an in-memory Sig_structure is generated. Its body_protected field is populated with the contents of the protected header bucket from the COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8152#section-4.4). For the payload field, if the payload was specified as present in the signature, it is populated from the payload field of the COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure. If the payload was specified as detached, the payload field of the COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure will be nil. In this case, the contents of the payload field of Sig_structure shall be populated from the same external source that was used in the generation of the signature. These are defined in the places where the digital signature is used in this specification. A C2PA Manifest Consumer may wish to display an icon or logo for the signer. To locate such a graphic, it shall look inside the embedded certificate for a logotype as defined in RFC 6170. If no logotype is present, the Manifest Consumer may use icons or logos from other sources in an implementation-dependent manner. The IETF is working on an update for RFC 6170 referred to as RFC 3709-bis-04. It is recommended that when this update is approved, that it be used instead. The above model shows, in yellow, green and red, the three entities specified in the trust model, which is concerned with trust in a signer’s identity. In dashed lines, below, is the consumer (who is not specified in the trust model), who uses the identity of the signer, along with other trust signals, to decide whether the assertions made about an asset are true. Identity in the trust model is the means by which a cryptographic signing key is associated with an actor for the basis of making trust decisions based on any structure (including, but not limited to, claims and manifests) signed with that key. The identity of a signatory is not necessarily a human actor, and the identity presented may be a pseudonym, completely anonymous, or pertain to a service or trusted hardware device with its own identity, including an application running inside such a service or trusted hardware. The credential should be listed in the COSE unprotected headers of the COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure used for digital signatures in all C2PA manifests. The credential may appear in the protected headers, though as all credential types are themselves signed objects and so carry their own integrity protection, this is not necessary. Regardless, exactly one instance of an identity credential must appear in the union of the protected and unprotected headers. COSE_Sign1_Tagged structures with no credentials, or two or more credentials, must be rejected. Repeating the same credential more than once, including separately in the protected and unprotected headers, is also an instance of two or more credentials and must be rejected. Each credential type will define the following data to be provided to the validator: How the credential is stored in the header value, How a trust chain is computed from the signer to an entry in the validator’s trust anchor store for C2PA signers, The public key in the credential used to validate the signature, and The time validity period of the credential. The name of the header to indicate credential type, how the credential is stored in the header value, and how trust chains are constructed are specified for each credential type in Section 14.4, “Credential Types”. As part of the validation of an asset, the signer’s credential is validated as being trusted to sign manifests. Credential types are defined in Section 14.4, “Credential Types”. A validator shall maintain the following lists: A list of X.509 certificate trust anchors for C2PA signers, A list of accepted Extended Key Usage (EKU) values for C2PA signers, and A list of X.509 certificate trust anchors for Time Stamp Authorities. In this section, \"user\" refers to human actors that are using C2PA-compliant validators in consumption and authoring scenarios. A validator should allow these trust anchor stores to be configured by the user, and should provide default options or offer lists maintained by external parties that the user may opt into to populate the validator’s trust anchor store for C2PA signers or Time Stamp Authorities. A validator may also allow the user to create and maintain a private credential store of signing credentials for each credential type. This store is intended as an \"address book\" of credentials they have chosen to trust based on an out-of-band relationship. For example, a journalist may choose to add sources to their private credential store to facilitate accepting and validating media with C2PA provenance data attached, even though the sources themselves would have no reason to be on an externally-maintained trust list used broadly by the general public. Credentials in the private credential store may be self-issued, and may be anonymous or pseudonymous (that is, containing no identifying information about the signer, or information that only identifies by pseudonym). The private credential store shall only apply to validating signed C2PA manifests, and shall not apply to validating time-stamps. The private credential store shall only allow trust in signer certificates directly; entries in the private credential store cannot issue credentials and shall not be included as trust anchors during validation. A validator must not be pre-configured with any entries in a private credential store. A validator must only add entries to a private credential store in response to a user request to trust the credential. Similarly, a validator must only remove entries from a private credential store in response to a user request to stop trusting the credential. Each credential type defined in this section may be used to sign C2PA manifests. X.509 Certificates are stored as defined by the draft specification CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE): Header parameters for carrying and referencing X.509 certificates (draft-ietf-cose-x509) section 2. This is a draft at the time of publication of this specification, but a temporary integer label of 33 has been assigned by the IANA in the IANA COSE Header Parameters Registry. To prepare for the future standardization of this header: Claim generators shall write only the string x5chain as the label when inserting this header into a COSE signature. Validators shall accept either the string x5chain or the integer 33 as the label for this header. If both labels are present, validators shall use the header with the string x5chain as the label and ignore the header with the integer label 33. It will only be possible for both headers to be present in the unlikely event the IANA temporary assignment lapses, and the value 33 is assigned to another header type. Preferring the string label prevents a validator from misinterpreting the contents of a header with the integer label 33, if this happens. When draft-ietf-cose-x509 is adopted as a standard and the IANA assignment is permanent, a future version of this specification will deprecate use of the string label and prefer the integer label for both claim generators and validators, in addition to adopting any changes to the standard. Validators will still have to support the string label to maintain compatibility with assets compliant with this version of this specification. The definition of x5chain at time of this specification’s publication, taken from revision 08, is copied below. The definition here shall be used in this specification. x5chain: This header parameter contains an ordered array of X.509 certificates. The certificates are to be ordered starting with the certificate containing the end-entity key followed by the certificate which signed it and so on. There is no requirement for the entire chain to be present in the element if there is reason to believe that the relying party already has, or can locate the missing certificates. This means that the relying party is still required to do path building, but that a candidate path is proposed in this header parameter. The trust mechanism MUST process any certificates in this parameter as untrusted input. The presence of a self-signed certificate in the parameter MUST NOT cause the update of the set of trust anchors without some out-of-band confirmation. As the contents of this header parameter are untrusted input, the header parameter can be in either the protected or unprotected header bucket. This header parameter allows for a single X.509 certificate or a chain of X.509 certificates to be carried in the message. If a single certificate is conveyed, it is placed in a CBOR byte string. If multiple certificates are conveyed, a CBOR array of byte strings is used, with each certificate being in its own byte string. When creating the x5chain header as part of signing, the signer’s certificate and all intermediate certificate authorities shall be included in the header’s value. The trust anchor’s certificate (also called the root certificate) should not be included. The subjectPublicKeyInfo element of the first or only certificate will be the public key used to validate the signature. The validity element of the tbsCertificate sequence provides the time validity period of the certificate. This section defines the requirements to validate that an X.509 certificate is acceptable as a signing credential as described in Section 15.4, “Validate the Signature”. All certificates must fulfil the following requirements. The algorithm field of the signatureAlgorithm field shall be one of the following values: ecdsa-with-SHA256 RFC 5758 section 3.2 ecdsa-with-SHA384 RFC 5758 section 3.2 ecdsa-with-SHA512 RFC 5758 section 3.2 sha256WithRSAEncryption RFC 8017 appendix A.2.4 sha384WithRSAEncryption RFC 8017 appendix A.2.4 sha512WithRSAEncryption RFC 8017 appendix A.2.4 id-RSASSA-PSS RFC 8017 appendix A.2.3 id-Ed25519 RFC 8410 section 3 If the algorithm field of the signatureAlgorithm field is id-RSASSA-PSS, the parameters field is of type RSASSA-PSS-params. Its fields shall have the following requirements: RFC 8017 section A.2.3 The hashAlgorithm field shall be present. The algorithm field of the hashAlgorithm field shall be one of the following values: RFC 8017 appendix B.1 id-sha256 id-sha384 id-sha512 The maskGenAlgorithm field shall be present. The algorithm field of the parameters field of the maskGenAlgorithm field shall be equal to the algorithm field of the hashAlgorithm field. If the algorithm field of the algorithm field of the certificate’s subjectPublicKeyInfo is id-ecPublicKey, the parameters field shall be one of the following named curves: RFC 5480 section 2.1.1.1 prime256v1 secp384r1 secp521r1 If the algorithm field of the algorithm field of the certificate’s subjectPublicKeyInfo is rsaEncryption or rsaPSS, the modulus field of the parameters field shall have a length of at least 2048 bits. All certificates except those in the private credential store for X.509 certificates must fulfill the following additional requirements to be acceptable. Version must be v3. RFC 5280 section 4.1.2.1 The issuerUniqueID and subjectUniqueID optional fields of the TBSCertificate sequence must not be present. RFC 5280 section 4.1.2.8 The Basic Constraints extension must follow RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.9. In particular, it must be present with the cA boolean asserted if the certificate issues certificates, and not asserted if it does not. The Authority Key Identifier extension must be present in any certificate that is not self-signed. RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.1 The Subject Key Identifier extension must be present in any certificate that acts as a CA. It should be present in end entity certificates. RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.2 The Key Usage extension must be present and should be marked as critical. Certificates used to sign C2PA manifests must assert the digitalSignature bit. The keyCertSign bit must only be asserted if the cA boolean is asserted in the Basic Constraints extension. RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.3 The Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension must be present and non-empty in any certificate where the Basic Constraints extension is absent or the cA boolean is not asserted. These are commonly called \"end entity\" or \"leaf\" certificates. RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.12 The anyExtendedKeyUsage EKU (2.5.29.37.0) must not be present. If the configuration store contains a list of EKUs, a certificate that signs C2PA manifests must be valid for at least one of the listed purposes. If the configuration store does not contain a list of EKUs, a certificate that signs C2PA manifests must be valid for the id-kp-emailProtection (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4) purpose. The id-kp-emailProtection purpose is not implicitly included by default if a list of EKUs has been configured. If desired, it must explicitly be added to the list in the configuration store. A certificate that signs time-stamping countersignatures must be valid for the id-kp-timeStamping (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8) purpose. A certificate that signs OCSP responses for certificates must be valid for the id-kp-OCSPSigning (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) purpose. If a certificate is valid for either id-kp-timeStamping or id-kp-OCSPSigning, it must be valid for exactly one of those two purposes, and not valid for any other purpose. A certificate should not be valid for any other purposes outside of the purposes listed above, but the presence of any EKUs not mentioned in this profile and not in the list of EKUs in the configuration store shall not cause the certificate to be rejected. When validating a certificate as the signing credential, if the certificate is present in the private credential store for X.509 certificates, the certificate is accepted. The private credential store is not consulted when validating time-stamps. If the certificate is not present in the private credential store, or the validator does not implement one, the trust chain shall be built and validated according to the procedure in RFC 5280 section 6 for the particular purpose required (signing, time-stamping, or OCSP signing) and for the appropriate trust anchor store for that purpose. Any failure of that validation algorithm shall mean the chain must be rejected. The private credential store is never included when building certificate chains; certificates in the private credential store cannot act as CAs. Only end entity certificates shall be used to sign C2PA manifests or time-stamps. A CA certificate must not be used for these purposes. Any CA certificate (where the cA boolean in the Basic Constraints extension is asserted) being used to validate a signature on a C2PA manifest, time-stamp, or OCSP response must be rejected. A validator must ensure a signing certificate is authorized for the purpose for which it is being used, and reject certificates used for an unauthorized purpose. A certificate is authorized for a particular purpose if the purpose’s EKU Object Identifier (OID) is present in the Extended Key Usage extension of the certificate (RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.12). When validating a certificate chain used to sign a C2PA manifest, the signing certificate must have one of the accepted EKUs for C2PA signers if configured, or the id-kp-emailProtection (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4) EKU if such a list is not configured. When validating a certificate chain used to sign a time-stamp, the signing certificate must have the id-kp-timeStamping (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8) EKU. When validating a certificate chain used to sign an OCSP response, the signing certificate must have the id-kp-OCSPSigning (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) EKU. Except for certificates accepted through the private credential store for X.509 certificates, a validator must verify a certificate’s compliance with the Certificate Profile, and reject certificates that do not comply. This includes requiring the presence of the Extended Key Usage extension, as well as a certificate being authorized for no more than one of the three purposes listed in this section: C2PA signing, time-stamp signing, or OCSP response signing. As described in the Certificate Profile, Certification Authority (CA) certificates which issue certificates are not required to have an EKU extension, and usually will not. If one is present, it is ignored. This requirement only applies to end entity certificates signing C2PA manifests, time-stamps, or OCSP responses. CA certificates cannot be used for signing C2PA manifests, time-stamps, or OCSP responses. X.509 certificates support revocation status queries. C2PA uses the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and OCSP stapling to implement revocation. C2PA does not use Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). Using CRLs requires downloading the entire list of revoked certificates for each Certificate Authority encountered, which can be time-consuming. Although a CRL could be included in the same way an OCSP response is stapled, the potential size of a CRL relative to an OCSP response also makes this undesirable. A conforming CA should include an AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) extension (RFC 5280 section 4.2.2.1) to provide access information for an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service operated by the CA. If the certificate has an AIA extension, revocation information shall be stored in an unprotected header of the COSE_Sign1 structure with the string label rVals and the value shall follow the following CDDL: ; CBOR version of rVals and related structures based on JSON schema in https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010101p.pdf section 5.3.5.2 rVals = { \"ocspVals\": [1* bstr] } The above definition is a CBOR adaptation of a subset of the schema from JAdES section 5.3.5.2, which only stores OCSP responses, and stores them as binary strings. Before signing a claim, if a signer’s certificate has the AIA extension, a signer should query the OCSP service indicated therein, capture the response, and store it in an element of the ocspVals array of the rVals header. A validator must follow the requirements of RFC 6960, in particular section 3, when constructing an OCSP query and accepting an OCSP response. If the response is not accepted, or contains a certStatus of unknown, nothing can be concluded about the certificate’s revocation status, and therefore: If the unusable response is in an rVals header, the validator must proceed as if the header was absent. If the unusable response is received in reply to an OCSP query at validation time, the validator must proceed as if it chose not to make the query. An accepted OCSP response in the rVals header establishes that the signer’s certificate was not revoked at the time of signing if all of the following requirements are met: The manifest has a valid time-stamp, and the attested time falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval of the response, The certStatus field of the response is good, or revoked but with a revocationReason of removeFromCRL, and The signer of the response is an \"authorized responder\" as defined by RFC 6960 section 4.2.2.2. The removeFromCRL is unique amongst the values of revocationReason because it is equivalent to a good response. Despite being a type of revoked response, this response indicates the certificate had temporarily been put \"on hold\" (the certificateHold reason) previously due to some concern about its integrity, but that the concern has been resolved and the issuer is stating the certificate remains trustworthy. Validators must check the revocationReason of any revoked response to disambiguate the removedFromCRL case from an actual revocation. If the rVals header is not present or does not contain an accepted OCSP response, or if the manifest does not have a time-stamp, but the certificate has an AIA extension, the validator may choose to query the OCSP responder, as described in Section 15.6, “Validate the Credential Revocation Information”. If it does, and the response is accepted per the requirements of RFC 6960, it shall establish the signer’s certificate was not revoked at the time of signing if either of the following requirements is fulfilled: The manifest has a valid time-stamp, and the attested time falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval of the response, or The manifest does not have a valid time-stamp but the current time falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval of the response, And both of the following requirements are fulfilled: The certStatus field of the response is good, or revoked but with a revocationReason of removeFromCRL, and The signer of the response is an \"authorized responder\" as defined by RFC 6960 section 4.2.2.2. If the certStatus field of the response is revoked but with a revocationReason that is not removeFromCRL, it shall establish the signer’s certificate was not revoked at the time of signing if both of the following requirements are met: The manifest has a valid time-stamp, and the attested time falls within the (thisUpdate,nextUpdate) interval of the response, and The revocationTime in the response is after the attested time-stamp. Otherwise, the certificate shall be considered revoked at the time of signing and the claim shall be rejected. Some assertions (such as stds.schema-org.CreativeWork) allow a person’s identity to be associated in a defined way with the asset. This identity is purely scoped via the definition in each assertion and does not imply any larger involvement or responsibility for any assertion made in the claim, or the asset itself. All assertions, as stated below, are made by a signer. A validator is a manifest consumer that will produce some validation statements about that asset. The actor consuming the asset, usually through their user agent and its user interface, then has to interpret those statements to arrive at a set of conclusions of their own about the provenance of the asset they are consuming. These conclusions will be drawn from these statements, the set of trust relationships that consumer currently has with the actors in the asset, and the contents of the asset itself. A validator can make the following true or false statements about the asset they are validating, and no more. The active manifest has not been modified since the active manifest was signed The portions of the asset that are covered by content bindings have not been modified since the active manifest was produced The claim was produced by a claim generator (typically software), and signed by an actor identified in the subject field of the signing credential The assertions of the active manifest are statements by the signer and their contents are not verified The assertions of the active manifest have not been modified since the active manifest was produced The assets referred to by ingredient assertions are not (necessarily) available at validation of the active manifest, and therefore their hashes cannot be validated The ingredient assertion may contain a validationStatus field that indicates the active manifest signer’s assessment of the validation state of the ingredient at the time of adding the ingredient The content of ingredient assertions, like all other assertions, is not independently validated Endorsements are a way of indicating approval of three possible actions, c2pa.published, c2pa.transcoded and c2pa.repackaged, that could be applied to an asset in a C2PA manifest in which the asset is used as an ingredient. For example, the signer of a C2PA Manifest may want to endorse another party who wishes to transcode its asset. The signer creates an endorsement that identifies the transcoder, and conveys the endorsement to them (in some method that is out-of-band from this specification). When the transcoder creates their asset containing the ingredient, they include the endorsement as a c2pa.endorsement assertion, which lets the manifest consumer know that the actions they performed have been endorsed. Endorsements are made by signers, and describe the actor they are endorsing through the use of their signing credentials and a validity period. These endorsements are conveyed out-of-band from the endorser to the endorsee. When the endorsee is using an asset created by the endorser as an ingredient in their own asset, they shall include the endorsement in its C2PA Manifest. Endorsements endorse the specific actions (described in Section 15.9, “Validate the Endorsements”) that may be taken by the endorsee, and are therefore valid for asset manifests that use only the specified actions. Actions are only endorsed by the signer of that action’s referenced ingredient; they cannot be endorsed across more than multiple C2PA Manifests in the asset’s provenance. Endorsements are COSE objects (see Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures”), where the COSE payload is an \"endorsement target\" data structure encoded as CBOR, as shown below. The endorseeCredential field is an object with a single field, labelled according to the type of credential used to sign the endorsement. The label of this field indicates to validators the type of the credential present, so that they know how to decode, parse and validate the credential correctly. The following table details the format of each of the currently specified credential types: Credential name CBOR label Value type Compares To Reserved 0 X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo 1 A DER-encoded ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure (as a CBOR bstr), from the endorsee’s X.509 certificate that will be used for signing the claims of assets that this endorsement is expected to be used with. The value of the credential shall be compared (bitwise identical) to the SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure of the certificate located in the x5chain or 33 (integer) COSE header of the active manifest Claim Signature (see [x_509_certificates]) Endorsers shall place the credential of the signer they are endorsing and its type in the endorseeCredential. To limit the length of time that an endorser is lending their endorsement to another signer, the notValidBefore and notValidAfter fields contain ISO 8601 date times. The CDDL schema for the endorsement target type is: endorsement-target-map = { \"endorseeCredential\" : public-credential, ; A DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo containing the public key \"notValidBefore\": tdate, ; The date-time that this endorsement valid from, before this time it is not valid \"notValidAfter\": tdate ; The date-time that this endorsement expires and is no longer valid } public-credential = { $credential-type: any ; an extensible field allowing the specification of the credential payload } $credential-type /= 1 ; credentials with this type are a DER-encoded ASN.1 SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure, as a bstr (specification text for usage) An example endorsement target is show below: { \"endorseeCredential\": { 1: 'A DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo containing the public key of the signer to be endorsed' }, \"notValidBefore\": 0(\"2021-03-21T20:04:00Z\"), \"notValidAfter\": 0(\"2022-03-21T20:04:00Z\") } To sign an endorsement, follow the procedure specified in Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures”, using the serialised CBOR endorsement-target object as the contents of the payload field. A signer shall not include a x5chain header and value, as endorsements are validated in the context of their use as an ingredient, and therefore use the signing credential of that ingredient manifest (see Endorsement Validation). The serialized COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure resulting from the digital signature procedure is the endorsement that may be conveyed to the signer identified in the endorsment-target, but the process for conveying it is out of scope of this specification. If the active manifest signer possesses an endorsement that it wishes to use to endorse an action performed by an actor, it can choose to embed the endorsement in the manifest it is generating. The procedure for the validation of such endorsements is covered in Section 15.9, “Validate the Endorsements”. An endorsement is added as an Section 18.13, “Endorsement Assertion” in the active manifest’s assertion store. The active manifest of an asset is valid only if all the steps in this section are successful. This validation must be completed before a validator presents a successful result to a human user or begins to render any content. Validating content as it is rendered to the user is described in Section 15.11, “Validate the Asset’s Content”. The validation algorithm outputs status codes to indicate successful or failed portions of the validation process. They are also used by ingredient assertions to document the validation done on ingredients during the claim generation process. The set of standard success and failure codes are defined below. Custom status codes are also permitted, when a claim generator has a need to record some process-specific status information. The code shall conform to the same syntax as custom labels, e.g. com.litware. When using custom labels, because they are not inherently success or failure codes, a boolean success or failure result must be returned as well. This is either part of the output of the validation algorithm when performing validation, or the value of the success boolean in the validationStatus object inside an ingredient assertion. The CDDL Definition for status codes is included in the schema for the ingredient assertion at Section 18.11.4, “Schema and Example”.

C2PA Claim Box or C2PA Assertion general.error A value to be used when there was an error not specifically listed here. C2PA Claim Box or C2PA Assertion The last C2PA Manifest superbox in the C2PA Manifest Store superbox is the active manifest, but locating the C2PA Manifest Store may involve looking in a number possible locations. The manifest consumer shall look inside the asset for an embedded C2PA Manifest Store in the standard locations for embedding manifests to see if one is present. If there are multiple C2PA Manifest Stores present in an asset, they shall all be considered as invalid and the validation should treat this as if no manifests were located. In the case where this asset is being added as an ingredient, none of these embedded C2PA manifests shall be included in the ingredient assertion. If there is no embedded C2PA Manifest Store, the following attempts should be made to locate one at a remote location. If the asset was retrieved via an HTTP connection, the manifest consumer should look in the header of the HTTP response for a Link header, as defined in RFC 8288, containing a parameter of rel=c2pa-manifest. If present, a C2PA Manifest Store can be retrieved from that URI reference. HTTP refers to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol defined in RFC 7230, not the specific URL scheme http://. If the asset has XMP and the XMP contains a dcterms:provenance key, the provided URI should be used to locate the active manifest. If no C2PA Manifest Store has been located, the manifest consumer should look for files at the same path or URI, but with a filename extension of .c2pa. If the C2PA Manifest Store is not found, a manifest consumer may look in whatever additional places it deems most appropriate to locate it. For example, a child folder of a file system. A manifest consumer is not restricted to only the above locations, it can choose to look in additional locations as well. Information about the IANA media type for a C2PA Manifest Store can be found in the external manifests section. A manifest consumer may wish to validate that the located C2PA Manifest Store is indeed the one associated with asset. If the C2PA Manifest Store was located then the hard binding assertion present in its active manifest shall be used to validate that it is the matching manifest and whether the asset has been modified without manifest updates. If the hard binding does not match, it is unknown if that is because of (a) modification of the asset or (b) the wrong C2PA Manifest Store was located. Accordingly, the manifest consumer shall treat this as a non-matching hard binding and reject the manifest with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.mismatch if a data hash assertion is used or assertion.bmffHash.mismatch if a BMFF hash assertion is used. Once an active manifest has been located, the claim is found by locating, within the active manifest, the JUMBF Superbox with a label of c2pa.claim and a UUID of 0x6332636C-0011-0010-8000-00AA00389B71 (c2cl). There shall only be one such box in the active manifest, if more than one is located, the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of claim.multiple. Retrieve the URI reference for the signature from the value of the claim’s signature field and resolve the URI reference to obtain the COSE signature. The signature must be embedded in the same manifest as described in Section 11.1.1, “C2PA Box details”. If the signature URI does not refer to a location within the same C2PA Manifest box (a self#jumbf location), the claim must be rejected. If no such field is present or the URI cannot be resolved, then the claim must be rejected with a failure code of claimSignature.missing. The signature and the claim need to be in the same manifest to be valid. Validate that the credential used in the signature is acceptable according to Chapter 14, Trust Model for the credential’s type. If a chain of trust cannot be built from the credential to an entry in the trust anchor list, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.untrusted. If the credential is not acceptable per the requirements of the credential’s type, then the claim must be rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.invalid. If the signature algorithm is not on the allowed or deprecated list in Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures”, then the claim must be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported. After confirming the credential type and signing algorithm are acceptable, validation should proceed according to the specified procedure in Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures”. If validation of the signature fails, then the claim must be rejected with a failure code of claimSignature.mismatch. For the remainder of this chapter, headers refer to the union of the set of protected and unprotected header parameters in the COSE signature. Unless otherwise specified in Section 13.2, “Digital Signatures” or Section 14.4, “Credential Types”, a header may appear in either bucket. RFC8152 section 3 describes COSE headers. If the sigTst header is not present, the claim is valid if the current time is within the validity period of the signer’s credential. If it is not, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.expired. If the sigTst header is present, the claim is valid if the tstTokens array contains at least one tstToken whose val property is an RFC3161-compliant TimeStampResp which satisfies the following requirements: The time-stamp contains a message imprint as described in Section 10.3.2.5, “Time-stamps” that matches the claim being validated. The claim must be rejected with a failure code of timeStamp.mismatch if it does not match. The time attested by the Time Stamp Authority (TSA) falls within the validity period of the signing credential. The claim must be rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.expired if it does not. The attested time falls within the validity period of the TSA’s signing certificate, The claim must be rejected with a failure code of timeStamp.outsideValidity if it does not. A trust chain can be built to an entry in the TSA trust store as described in Section 14.3, “Signer Credential Trust”. Locating the TSA’s certificate in the TimeStampResp is described in RFC 3161 section 2.4.1. The claim must be rejected with a failure code of timeStamp.untrusted if a trust chain cannot be built. At this time, the revocation status of a Time Stamp Authority’s certificate is neither captured at signing time nor validated at validation time. If the signer’s credential type does not support revocation status, or the credential’s issuer did not provide a method to query its revocation status, the validator presumes the credential is not revoked. If the signer’s credential type supports revocation, and the credential’s issuer provided a method to query its revocation status: If the rVals header is present, its contents shall be validated as described in Section 14.4, “Credential Types” for the signer credential type. If the rVals header is not present, and the signer’s credential is considered valid by the requirements of Section 15.4, “Validate the Signature” and Chapter 14, Trust Model, a validator may choose to query the credential status method to determine if the credential is currently revoked. If the validator does not query the credential status, the validator shall presume the credential is not revoked. If the validator does query the credential status, it shall determine the status from the response as described in Section 14.4, “Credential Types” for the signer’s credential type. Querying the credential status method can reveal to an observer the identity of the asset being validated, and so this query is optional. When a signer’s credential is revoked, this does not invalidate manifests that were signed before the time of revocation. The inclusion of the rVals header combined with a time-stamp provides proof that the signer’s credential was valid at the time of signing. Signers are encouraged to include revocation information and time-stamps to avoid the necessity of a query at validation time. In all cases, if the credential is deemed revoked at the time of signing, the claim shall be rejected with a failure code of signingCredential.revoked. Depending on the type of manifest, there are assertions that are either required or forbidden. A validator shall check for required and not-permitted assertions. If it is a standard manifest Validate that there is at exactly one hard binding to content assertion - either a c2pa.hash.data, a c2pa.hash.bmff (deprecated), or a c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 based on the type of asset for which the manifest is destined. If no such assertion is present, the manifest must be rejected with a failure code of claim.hardBindings.missing. If there is more than one such assertion, the manifest must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.multipleHardBindings. Validate that there are zero or one c2pa.ingredient assertions whose relationship is parentOf. If there is more than one, the manifest must be rejected with a failure code of manifest.multipleParents. If it is an update manifest Validate that there are not any c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.bmff, c2pa.hash.bmff.v2, c2pa.actions or Thumbnail assertions. If there are, the manifest must be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.invalid. Validate that there is exactly one c2pa.ingredient assertion and whose relationship is parentOf. If there is not (i.e., either it is missing, there are more than one, or the value of relationship is not parentOf), the manifest must be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.wrongParents. For each manifest, there may be a set of its assertions that were redacted from it. The list of those assertions is not found in the manifest itself but instead in a manifest that references it as an ingredient. Therefore a validator, when processing a claim, shall gather the set of redacted assertion for each ingredient manifest based on each hashed_uri listed in the redacted_assertions field. A claim’s redacted_assertions field shall never include a hashed_uri to any of its own assertions. Each assertion in the assertions field of the claim is a hashed_uri structure. For each assertion, the validator must: If the URI reference in the url field is in the list of redacted assertions: If the assertion’s label is c2pa.actions, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.redacted as c2pa.actions assertions shall not be redacted. Otherwise, the redacted assertion is considered valid, and validation continues to the next assertion. For all other assertions: Resolve the URI reference in the url field to obtain its data. If the URI does not refer to a location within the same C2PA Manifest Store (a self#jumbf location), the claim must be rejected. If the URI cannot be resolved and the data retrieved, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.missing. A claim can refer to an assertion in a different C2PA Manifest box than the one it is in, provided that they are both in the same C2PA Manifest Store. If the assertion’s label is c2pa.cloud-data: If the label field of the external assertion is c2pa.hash.data, c2pa.hash.bmff, or c2pa.hash.bmff.v2, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.cloud-data.hardBinding. If the manifest is an update manifest and the label field of the external assertion is c2pa.actions, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.cloud-data.actions. Compute a hash of the data using the hash algorithm, determined by following the procedure described in Section 13.1, “Hashing”: If an alg field is present in the hashed_uri structure, that determines the hash algorithm. If an alg field is not present in the hashed_uri structure, an alg field must be present in an enclosing structure, and the nearest instance present determines the hash algorithm. If no alg field is found in any of these locations: If an alg field is present in the claim, that determines the hash algorithm. If no alg field is present in the claim, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch. If the assertion’s label is c2pa.actions: For each action in the actions list: If the action field is c2pa.opened, c2pa.placed, c2pa.removed, c2pa.repackaged, or c2pa.transcoded: Check the ingredient field that is a member of the parameters object for the presence of a JUMBF URI. If the JUMBF URI is not present, or cannot be resolved to the related ingredient assertion, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch. Follow the JUMBF URI link in the ingredient field to the ingredient assertion. Check that the URI link resolves to an assertion in the active manifest. If it does not, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch. For c2pa.opened, c2pa.repackaged, or c2pa.transcoded: Check that the value of the relationship field is parentOf. If it is not, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch. For c2pa.placed or c2pa.removed: Check that the value of the relationship field is componentOf. If it is not, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch. Check the c2pa_manifest field in the ingredient assertion for the presence of a hashed URI. If the hashed URI is not present, or cannot be resolved to a manifest, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.action.ingredientMismatch. Locate the value of the alg field in the allowed list or the deprecated list in Section 13.1, “Hashing” to determine the hash algorithm. If it is not present in either list, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of algorithm.unsupported. Compare the computed hash value with the value in the hash field. If they do not match, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch. Otherwise, the assertion is valid and validation continues to the next assertion. Then, for each element of the claim’s own redacted_assertions array, if any element of the claim’s assertions array has a url field equal to that value, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of assertion.selfRedacted. A claim cannot redact its own assertions, only those of its ingredients. Some assertions support referencing other information in the C2PA Manifest via the use of a hashed_uri, for example, references to items in the W3C Credential Store or ingredient thumbnails. In those cases, when validation is taking place, and the destination of the hashed_uri cannot be located (i.e., that data isn’t present where it is supposed to be) then it shall be treated as a validation failure. As described in Chapter 8, W3C Verifiable Credentials, any proofs present inside a W3C Verifiable Credential are not validated. Like all contents of an assertion, C2PA only guarantees the contents of the credential are integrity-protected. The contents of a cloud data assertion, which contains the URI references to and hashes of external data, are validated like any other assertion, but those references are not retrieved and validated as part of standard validation. A validator must first successfully validate a claim before attempting to retrieve external data listed in a cloud data assertion. A validator must not attempt to retrieve external data from a rejected claim. As the retrieval of external data is optional, the inability to retrieve or validate external data shall not cause a claim to become rejected. If a validator chooses to retrieve any of the external data in a cloud data assertion, the validator must: First, determine the hash algorithm to be used. If an alg field is present in the hashed_ext_uri structure, that determines the hash algorithm. If an alg field is not present, the validator must abort the attempt to retrieve the external data. Locate the value of the alg field in the allowed list or the deprecated list in Section 13.1, “Hashing” to determine the hash algorithm. If it is not present in either list, the validator must abort the attempt to retrieve the external data. The alg field is mandatory in hashed_ext_uri, so no recursive procedure to determine the hash algorithm is required. Resolve the URI reference in the url field to obtain its data. If the URI cannot be resolved and the data retrieved, the validator must abort the attempt to retrieve the external data. If the size of the retrieved data is not equal to the value of the size field, the validator must return a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch to the application and not provide the retrieved data. If the content type of the retrieved data, as determined by the Content-Type header of the HTTP response, is not equal to the value of the content_type field, the validator must return a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch to the application and not provide the retrieved data. Compute a hash of the data using the hash algorithm, determined by following the procedure described in Section 13.1, “Hashing”: Compare the computed hash value with the value in the hash field. If they do not match, the validator must return a failure code of assertion.hashedURI.mismatch to the application and not provide the retrieved data. Otherwise, the retrieved data is successfully provided to the application. A validator must perform the above validation steps for the asset being presented and its manifest. If any of the above steps conclude the manifest is invalid, that manifest must be rejected with the indicated failure code. An asset’s manifest may list one or more ingredients. For standard manifests, a validator may choose to optionally recurse through any ingredient manifests, however the parentOf ingredient of an update manifest shall be validated by the procedure below. There is no requirement that signers of ingredient manifests are trusted by the validator (except in the case of endorsement validation), and building of trust chains of signers of ingredients shall not be attempted. Instead, as the ingredient is included by the signer of the active manifest, and if the signer of the active manifest is accepted per the rules above, ingredient manifests will share in that trust for the purposes of this recursive validation. Applications should not display data from ingredient manifests with failed integrity checks. If the application chooses to display such data, it must flag the display with a warning about the failed integrity check, and that the data cannot be reliably attributed to the ingredient manifest’s signer nor to the asset’s manifest’s signer. When ingredients are being added to an asset as part of an authoring workflow, the ingredient may undergo full validation and the results expressed in a validation status. In this scenario, the ingredient’s manifest is considered the active manifest for validation purposes, before the ingredient is added to another asset’s ingredients. For consumption scenarios, it is expected that problems with ingredient manifests from a standard manifest would be ignored during normal consumption use but may be surfaced as a warning if a user opts to explore the provenance history. However, the parentOf ingredient of an update manifest shall be surfaced. In authoring scenarios, it may be desirable to more prominently raise warnings so that a creator making use of such an asset with a flawed provenance history can make an informed decision of how to proceed. If the manifest is an update manifest, or if a validator chooses to validate the ingredients of a standard manifest, then for each ingredient, it must recursively: If the ingredient does not have a c2pa_manifest field If the manifest is a standard manifest, then the ingredient is accepted. If the manifest is an update manifest, then the claim must be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.wrongParents. If the ingredient does have a c2pa_manifest field: Create an list of redacted assertions which is the concatenation of the claim’s redacted_assertions array with any pre-existing redacted assertions list from previous recursive calls. This list is therefore only the redacted assertions from the active manifest’s claim and any ingredients along the path to the current ingredient. Resolve the URI reference in the url field to obtain the ingredient claim’s manifest. If the URI reference cannot be resolved, the ingredient claim is rejected with a failure code of claim.missing. Determine the hash algorithm identifier as determined by following the procedure described in Section 13.1, “Hashing”: If an alg field is present in the hashed_uri structure, that determines the hash algorithm. If an alg field is not present in the hashed_uri structure, an alg field must be present in an enclosing structure, and the nearest instance present determines the hash algorithm. If no alg field is found in any of these locations, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of ingredient.hashedURI.mismatch. Compute the hash of the ingredient manifest’s data using that algorithm. Compare the computed hash with the value in the hash field. If the hashes are not equal, the claim must be rejected with a failure code of ingredient.hashedURI.mismatch. If the ingredient contains a validationStatus field, each of the entries in the array shall be evaluated. If the code field of any validationStatus equals a failure code or has a success field with a value of false, as defined at Section 15.1.2, “Failure codes”, the ingredient’s claim is admitted. An admitted manifest is treated like an accepted manifest, but with an explicit indication that it may contain validation errors that are known to the signer. If admitted in this way, the validator must present each validationStatus present in the validationStatus field array as part of any exploration of the provenance history. Validators should perform full validation if exploration of the provenance history of the ingredient is requested to indicate where there are validation errors. The presence of a validationStatus with a failure code or with a success field with a value of false is an explicit statement by the signer that they acknowledged and have chosen to override validation errors in the ingredient’s claim itself. Otherwise, validate the ingredient claim and assertions as described beginning in Section 15.4, “Validate the Signature”, except skip establishing signer credential trust, as this is not applicable to ingredients. When validating the assertions as described in Section 15.7, “Validate the Assertions”, provide a list of redacted assertions as an input. The validator may optionally recursively validate the ingredient’s ingredients. If it does and those are accepted, the ingredient’s claim is accepted. If any are rejected, the ingredient’s claim is rejected. If the validator chooses not to recurse further, the ingredient’s claim is accepted. Endorsement validation shall only be attempted if the active manifest first meets a number of conditions: An actions assertion is present in the assertion store There is exactly one ingredient assertion Retrieve the endorsement assertion in the active manifest, as described in Section 18.13, “Endorsement Assertion”. In order to provide resilience in the case of a claim generator unexpectedly adding multiple endorsement assertions to an assertion store, a validator may iterate through the validation process below with each endorsement, stopping the iteration immediately if an endorsement validates successfully. For each action object in the actions assertion: Check that the action field is set to c2pa.published, c2pa.transcoded or c2pa.repackaged. If any other action is present, fail the endorsement process for this manifest and do not proceed with further validation. Check the ingredient field that is a member of the parameters object for the presence of a JUMBF URI. If the JUMBF URI is not present, or cannot be resolved to the related ingredient assertion, skip endorsement for this action. Follow the JUMBF URI link in the ingredient field to the ingredient assertion. Check that the URI link resolves to an assertion in the active manifest. If it does not, skip endorsement for this action. Check that the relationship field is parentOf. If it is not, skip endorsement for this action. Check the c2pa_manifest field in the ingredient assertion for the presence of a hashed URI. If the hashed URI is not present, or cannot be resolved to a manifest, skip endorsement for this action. Follow the JUMBF URI link in the c2pa_manifest field to the ingredient’s manifest. Ensure that this ingredient manifest has been validated according to Section 15.8, “Recursively Validating Integrity of Ingredients”, but do not skip the establishing of signer credential trust. If it does not validate, skip endorsement for this action. Validate the endorsement as described in Section 15.4, “Validate the Signature”, using the credential of the ingredient manifest signer. If a signing credential is present in the endorsement’s signature’s headers, it shall not be used for validation. If validation fails, skip this action. Validate the endorsement-target payload itself, following the steps below: Compare the endorseeCredential to the credential of the active manifest signer, according to the table found in Section 14.7.1.1, “Endorsement Credential Types”. If the comparison fails, skip this endorsement. If the active manifest is timestamped, then the time-stamp must fall within the endorsement’s validity time range. If it does not, skip this endorsement. If the active manifest is not timestamped, then the time of validation must fall within the endorsement’s validity time range. If it does not, skip this endorsement. If validation fails, skip this endorsement. If validation succeeds, mark that action as endorsed. When endorsement validation has completed, for each actions assertion in the active manifest where all actions are marked as endorsed, the actions assertion itself shall be marked as endorsed in the validation results returned by the validator. Here is a visual representation of the process of validating a claim (and its assertions). Figure 13. Validating a Claim If the active manifest is an update manifest, its Section 9.2, “Hard Bindings” are inherited from the parentOf ingredient’s manifest. If that manifest is also an update manifest, the search for a standard manifest shall recurse though the chain of ingredients. If no standard manifest is found, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of manifest.update.wrongParents. Once a standard manifest (and its bindings) has been located, the exclusion range(s) shall be extracted from the c2pa.hash.data assertion. If any update manifests were encountered then the length value of the exclusion range whose start value is the offset of the start of the entire C2PA manifest store shall be treated as the current length of the entire C2PA manifest store plus any file format specific extras. The hash algorithm (alg) specified in that c2pa.hash.data shall be computed over the bytes of the asset, minus those specified in the exclusion range(s). If the resultant hash does not match the value of the hash field in the c2pa.hash.data, then the manifest shall be rejected with a failure code of assertion.dataHash.mismatch. In JPEG-1 files, the file format extras described above would include any APP11 markers and their respective segment length bytes for APP11 segments. Because the segment lengths are inside the exclusion range, a validator shall match the total length of the exclusion range with that of the total length of all APP11 segments representing the C2PA Manifest to ensure that the length was not tampered with. A JPEG-1 file can contain APP11 segments for reasons other than C2PA (e.g., JPEG 360 or JPSec) and those are not included in these calculations. For any portions of an asset rendered for presentation to a user, including but not limited to audio, video, or text, the corresponding hard binding corresponding to the rendered content must be validated in accordance with Section 9.2, “Hard Bindings”. If at any time content fails to be validated, the validator must clearly signal to the user that some of the content does not match the claim, and if possible, should indicate what part of the content did not validate. If any content is absent for which content bindings exist, discovery of this absence is also a validation failure. The validator must continue to report validation has failed, even if later portions of the content validate correctly. For content that is not wholly available before rendering begins, such as during adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) and progressive download, absence of not-yet-available portions of content is not considered a validation failure. As the content becomes available, the validator must validate each portion of the content before it is rendered as previously described. In addition, the validator must validate that the sequence of said content is the same as when the manifest was produced. Unless the player has explicitly signalled the validator that a discontinuity is expected (e.g., when the consumer performs a manual seek operation via the UI), the validator must clearly signal to the user that an unexpected discontinuity has occurred whenever the sequence does not match. For content that is intentionally not being rendered as the claim generator originally intended, such as during fast-forward, rewind, or playback at a different speed, the validator may not be able to validate the content. In this case, the validator must clearly signal to the user that the content cannot be validated during the corresponding operation. The assertion.bmffHash.mismatch failure code is used for all failures described in this section. The C2PA intends to provide clear recommendations and guidance for implementers of provenance-enabled user experiences (UX). Developing these recommendations is an ongoing process that involves diverse stakeholders, with the results balancing uniformity and familiarity with utility and flexibility for users across contexts, platforms, and devices. These recommendations can be found in the User experience guidance document. The UX recommendations aim to define best practices for presenting C2PA provenance to consumers. The recommendations strive to describe standard, readily recognizable experiences that: provide asset creators a means to capture information and history about the content they are creating, and provide asset consumers information and history about the content they are experiencing, thereby empowering them to understand where it came from and decide how much to trust it. User interfaces designed for the consumption of C2PA provenance must be informed by the context of the asset. We have studied 4 primary user groups and a collection of contexts in which C2PA assets are encountered. These user groups have been defined in the C2PA Guiding Principles as Consumers, Creators, Publishers and Verifiers (or Investigators). To serve the needs of each of these groups across common contexts, exemplary user interfaces are presented for many common cases. These are recommendations, not mandates, and we expect best practices to evolve. Because the complete set of C2PA data for a given asset can be overwhelming to a user, we describe 4 levels of progressive disclosure which guide the designs: Level 1: An indication that C2PA data is present and its cryptographic validation status. Level 2: A summary of C2PA data available for a given asset. This level should provide enough information for the particular content, user, and context to allow the consumer to understand to a sufficient degree how the asset came to its current state. Level 3: A detailed display of all relevant provenance data. Note that the relevance of certain items over others is contextual and determined by the UX implementer. Level 4: For sophisticated, forensic investigatory usage, a tool capable of revealing all the granular detail of signatures and trust signals is recommended. The team authoring the UX recommendations is cognizant of its limitations and potential biases, recognizing that feedback, review, user testing and ongoing evolution is a key requirement for success. The recommendations will therefore be an evolving document, informed by real world experiences deploying C2PA UX across a wide variety of applications and scenarios. This section provides a summary of information security considerations and processes for technology described in the C2PA core specification. More detailed content will be provided in future releases of C2PA material including the Guidance document. Information security is a principal concern of C2PA. C2PA maintains a threat model and security considerations for the C2PA specification. This effort complements other security-related work within C2PA. Associated documentation is currently in development and can be found at Security Considerations. The C2PA is developing security considerations documentation that includes: A summary of relevant security features of C2PA technology Security considerations for practical use of C2PA technology Threats to C2PA technology and respective treatment of those threats, including countermeasures The C2PA builds security into our designs as they are being developed, but also expects that security design and threat modelling will continue as the system, ecosystem, and threat landscape evolve. To this end, the C2PA uses a focused threat modelling process to support development of a strong security and privacy design. Outcomes of the effort directly support development of explicit threats and security considerations documentation, but also facilitate security thinking throughout the design process. The threat modelling process combines synchronous (live) threat modelling sessions consisting of focused groups of subject matter experts (SMEs) with asynchronous development of content. The number of attendees in each synchronous session is kept small to promote efficient discussions, but all members of the C2PA have the opportunity to participate via either modality. Like other security activities, we expect our threat modelling process to evolve with the C2PA ecosystem. Process documentation is considered a guide rather than a strict directive on how threat modelling works within the C2PA. A variety of references and experiences are used to inform threat modelling and related security activities for the C2PA. This section provides a subset of public documents for reference. IETF on security considerations IETF on privacy considerations (guidelines) W3C security and privacy self-review questionnaire OAuth2 threat model (example) Threat modelling: Designing for Security OWASP Threat modelling Microsoft Threat modelling The C2PA Guiding Principles establish that C2PA specifications must be reviewed with a critical eye towards the potential abuse or misuse of the framework to cause unintended harms, threats to human rights, or disproportionate risks to vulnerable groups globally. To ensure that the C2PA is meeting this aspect of its principles, the harms, misuse, and abuse assessment aims to identify and address potential concerns during the specifications development and as encountered in subsequent implementations. In addition, the specifications are being reviewed to: Anticipate and mitigate potential abuse and misuse; Address common privacy concerns of its users; and Consider the needs of users and stakeholders throughout the world. The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment is an ongoing process. The information presented in the Harms Modelling documentation should not be considered the end result of a comprehensive evaluation, but as a basis for ongoing discussions centered on impacted communities, and aimed at mitigating potential abuse and misuse and protecting human rights. There are two critical aspects of the approach: Ongoing The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment necessarily accompanies the design and development, as well as implementation and use-stages of the C2PA by continuously informing the specifications development process, the implementation and user-experience guides, sensitization efforts, the governance of the Coalition and potentially multilateral cooperation for the promotion of a diverse C2PA ecosystem that serves a broad range of global contexts. Multi-disciplinary and diverse The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment should be a collaborative effort that includes multi-disciplinary experts and a broad range of stakeholders with lived, practical and technical experience of the issues from diverse geographical locations, cultural backgrounds and individual identities. Harms modelling focuses on analysing how a socio-technical system might negatively impact users, other stakeholders or broader society, or otherwise create or reenforce structures of injustice, threats to human rights, or disproportionate risks to vulnerable groups globally. The process of harms modelling systematically requires combining knowledge about a system architecture and its user affordances with historical and contextual evidence about the impact of similar existing systems on different social groups and participatory consultation with a range of communities who may be implicated by the system. This combined information frames the ability to anticipate harm and proactively identify responses. The Harms Modelling documentation describes the framework and the process carried out to date, followed by the methodology, an overview of the assessment, an outline for public review and feedback, and due diligence actions being developed to accompany version 1.0 of these specifications, its implementations and evolution. The harms, misuse and abuse assessment has informed, and should continue to inform, the development of the C2PA technical specifications as well as its accompanying documentation: Guidance for implementers User experience guidance Security Considerations Explainer In addition, the harms, misuse and abuse assessment should inform the governance of the Coalition and guide potential multilateral cooperation for the promotion of a diverse C2PA ecosystem that pushes for the optimization of the benefits in terms of trust in media, user control and transparency that prompted the development of the C2PA specifications. This section of the document lists the standard set of assertions for use by C2PA implementations, describing their syntax, usage, etc. To keep things simple, all example JUMBF URIs have been shortened for illustrative purposes - full URIs are necessary in the actual data. All C2PA standardized assertions use the JSON JUMBF content type, the CBOR JUMBF content type, or the Embedded File content type from ISO 19566-5:AMD-1. Entity-specific assertions can be any of those, any of the other JUMBF content types from ISO 19566-5, B.1 (such as XML) or may create its own (as per the instructions in ISO 19566-5, Table B.1). The Codestream content type shall not be used for a C2PA assertion. CBOR is not currently defined in 19566-5, but an upcoming update will define the type as cbor. Unless otherwise mentioned, all assertions documented in this standard set of assertions shall be serialized as CBOR. For all assertions of type CBOR, their schemas shall be defined using CDDL. For those defined using JSON, their schemas shall be defined using JSON Schema. All assertions shall have a label as described in Section 6.2, “Labels” and shall be versioned as described in Section 6.3, “Versioning”. All CBOR encoded data in a C2PA Manifest shall comply with the \"Core Deterministic Encoding Requirements\" of CBOR. When converting JSON data, based on one of the JSON Schemas documented here, to CBOR for the purposes of including as a valid C2PA assertion, the following shall be done: A JSON null shall be serialized as Null (major type 7, additional information 22). A JSON false shall be serialized as False (major type 7, additional information 20). A JSON true shall be serialized as True (major type 7, additional information 21). A JSON number shall be serialized either as an integer (major type 0 or 1) or a floating-point value (major type 7, additional information 25 through 27). A JSON string that does not have an alternate semantic type (e.g., date-time or uri) shall either be serialized as a fixed-length UTF-8 string (major type 3) without any null termination, if human consumable, or a byte string (major type 2) if not. For Base64-encoded strings, unless specified otherwise, they shall be encoded in CBOR as a byte string (major type 2) after decoding from Base64. A JSON string that is identified as a date-time shall be serialized with tag 0 (major type 6). A JSON string that is identified as a URI shall be serialized with tag 32 (major type 6). A JSON array shall be serialized as an array (major type 4). A JSON object shall be serialized as a map (major type 5), with each key being serialized as a UTF-8 string (major type 3). If a JSON object contains a key that is defined (by a specific schema) as optional, then either the key with an associated value shall be included in the map or neither its key nor any value shall be included in the map. Indefinite-length items (additional information 31) shall not be used. Accordingly, break codes (major type 7 and additional information value 31) shall not be used. A JSON null, a JSON array of length zero, nor a JSON string of length zero shall be used unless they are (a) the value of a required (by a specific schema) key in a JSON object or (b) there are explicitly defined semantics (by a specific schema) for their usage. The above list is based on an inversion of section 6.1 of CBOR with additions from C2PA best practices. In many cases, it is useful or even necessary to provide additional information about an assertion, such as the date and time when it was generated or other data that may help manifest consumers to make informed decisions about the provenance or veracity of the assertion data. A manifest consumer is not required to read any portion of assertion metadata. It can choose which, if any, fields it wishes to consume, perhaps even varying based on the assertion type to which it is applied. Below shows the core schemas used inside other assertions.

\"required\": [], \"additionalProperties\": true } In most cases, this assertion specific metadata will appear directly inside of other assertions (e.g., ingredients) as the value of their metadata field. However, sometimes it is necessary or desirable to store the assertion metadata in a separate, independent assertion metadata assertion, such as when an assertion is not in JSON or CBOR, such as thumbnails. Since the claim is a special type of assertion, it too supports having assertion metadata. The label for the assertion metadata assertion is c2pa.assertion.metadata. This dataSource field is an optional field that allows the claim signer to inform downstream manifest consumers about the source from which the assertion contents originated. If no dataSource is provided for a given assertion, the dataSource is considered to be the Signer. By default, all assertions are sourced to the Signer, as the Trust Model is rooted in trust of the Signer. Where a different source is indicated, it will be a useful Trust Signal to a manifest consumer. The value of the field is a dataSource object that is composed of three fields: type, details, and if applicable, credential. The dataSource type field defines the type of the dataSource. It is assembled with labels in the format described in Section 6.2, “Labels”. The value can be one of the following specification-defined values, or entity-specific labels can be used as an extension mechanism. Value of type Meaning signer The assertion contents came from the Signer claimGenerator.REE Assertion contents came from a claim generator running in a rich execution environment (REE), such as a desktop or mobile operating system claimGenerator.TEE Assertion contents came from a claim generator running in a trusted execution environment (TEE), such as a trusted OS localProvider.REE Assertion contents came from a data source running in an REE on the same physical computing device as the claim generator localProvider.TEE Assertion contents came from a data source running in a TEE on the same physical computing device as the claim generator remoteProvider Assertion contents came from a remote data source controlled by the signer or claim generator vendor remoteProvider.external Assertion contents came from an external, remote data source that is not the signer or claim generator vendor humanEntry.anonymous Assertion contents were entered by a human that wishes to remain anonymous humanEntry.identified Assertion contents were entered by an identified human actor(s), specified in the actors field of the dataSource. The details field is a human-readable string that provides additional information about the dataSource, e.g., the name of the API used to provide the assertion contents, or the URL of the server from which the contents were provided. For example, a broad location assertion source may have a type value of remoteProvider.3rdParty, with the details value set to www.googleapis.com/geolocation/v1/geolocate. If the value of the type field is humanEntry.identified, then an actors field shall contain an array of one or more actor objects as defined in Section 18.17, “Common Data Model: Actor”. When present, the reviewRatings array provides a place for the claim generator to provide one or more rating objects on the quality (or lack thereof) of an assertion. A reviewRatings shall not be present if a dataSource object is present with a type field whose value is either humanEntry.anonymous or humanEntry.credentialed. The value field of the rating object shall be present with any integer value from 1 (worst) through 5 (best). If present, the explanation field shall contain a human-consumable string description of the type of rating. In addition, an optional machine-readable code field which defines assertion-specific evaluation outcome codes may be provided. The value of the code field is assembled with labels in the format described in Section 6.2, “Labels”. The value can be one of the following specification-defined values, or entity-specific labels can be used as an extension mechanism. Value of code Applicable Assertion Meaning actions.unknownActionsPerformed c2pa.actions The actions assertion does not contain a full list of all actions performed in the authoring tool (e.g., because of the use of a 3rd party filter whose effect is unknown to the authoring tool). actions.placedIngredientNotFound c2pa.actions The actions assertion being reviewed has a placed action without a resolvable ingredient URI. value should be 1. ingredient.actionMissing c2pa.ingredient The ingredient assertion being reviewed does not have at least one action that references it in its claim. value should be 1. ingredient.notVisible c2pa.ingredient The ingredient assertion being reviewed is not visible in the digital content bound to that manifest. value should be 1. depthMap.sceneMismatch c2pa.depthmap.GDepth The contents of the depth map assertion do not correspond to the scene portrayed in the primary presentation in the asset (e.g., because of a picture-of-picture attack). thumbnail.primaryMismatch c2pa.thumbnail.claim The thumbnail’s contents do not match the contents of the primary presentation in the asset. stds.schema-org.CreativeWork.misattributed stds.schema-org.CreativeWork One or more of the roles listed in a CreativeWork assertion is misattributed to the wrong actor (e.g., the wrong credit is given for the editor role). stds.schema-org.CreativeWork.missingAttribution stds.schema-org.CreativeWork An attribution for a role in a CreativeWork assertion is missing (e.g., a person who played the role of producer is not credited). stds.iptc.location.inaccurate stds.iptc The reported location is inaccurate (e.g., reported to be in New York, NY but appears to be in another city entirely). Because the reference field of the assertion metadata assertion is a standard hashed_uri, it is also possible to have an assertion metadata assertion refer to assertions in other manifests than the active one. For example, the active manifest could include an assertion metadata assertion that validates the precise location assertion present in an ingredient’s manifest. Since the claim is a special type of assertion, this same method can be used to refer to claims in other manifests. If a dateTime field is present, its value shall be a date time string that complies with ISO 8601. It is important that consumers of C2PA manifests be able to understand the information in their native language, when possible. To this end, it is possible to add localization information for an assertion with a dictionary that is included in the assertion’s metadata. A localization dictionary consists of a single object, where each of its keys represent the translations using the language indexing technique. If the value that requires translation is not associated with a top-level key, then \"dot notation\" (.) shall be used to reference keys nested in objects. An array indexing notation ([n], n>=0) shall be used where a specific element in an array needs to be traversed. When the value requiring translation is itself an array, a specific element may be referenced. Some examples would be: { \"dc:title\": { \"en-US\": \"Kevin's Five Cats\", \"en-GB\": \"Lord Kevin's Five Cats\", \"es-MX\": \"Los Cinco Gatos de Kevin\", \"es-ES\": \"Los Thinco Gatos de Kevin\", \"fr\": \"Les Cinq Chats de Kevin\", \"jp\": \"ケヴィンの５匹の猫\" } } { \"copyrightHolder.legalName\": { \"en-US\": \"British Broadcasting Corporation\", \"en-GB\": \"British Broadcasting Corporation\", \"es\": \"British Broadcasting Corporation\", \"fr\": \"British Broadcasting Corporation\", \"jp\": \"英国放送協会\" } } { \"authors[2].name\": { \"en-US\": \"John Doe\", \"en-GB\": \"Joe Bloggs\" }, \"authors[2].aliases[0]\": { \"en-US\": \"John Smith\", \"en-GB\": \"Fred Bloggs\" }, \"authors[2].aliases[1]\": { \"en-US\": \"John Q. Public\", \"en-GB\": \"Joe Public\" } } Any such 3rd party keys or values are required to be namespaced in the same way as Section 6.2, “Labels”, e.g. com.litware. In order for a manifest consumer to display human-readable information about these keys and values, the claim generator should provide the strings via this localization approach. The following example shows how this could be used for localizing custom actions, by using this in the assertion metadata of a c2pa.actions assertion. { \"com.litware.blur\": { \"en-US\": \"Blur\", \"fr-FR\": \"Brouiller\", }, \"com.litware.filter\": { \"en-US\": \"Filter\", \"es-ES\": \"Filtrar\", \"jp-JP\": \"フィルター\" } } The standard C2PA assertions are: Type Assertion Schema Serialization Assertion Metadata c2pa.assertion.metadata C2PA CBOR Data Hash c2pa.hash.data C2PA CBOR BMFF-based Hash v1 (deprecated) c2pa.hash.bmff C2PA CBOR BMFF-based Hash v2 c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 C2PA CBOR Soft Binding c2pa.soft-binding C2PA CBOR Cloud Data c2pa.cloud-data C2PA CBOR Thumbnail c2pa.thumbnail.claim (claim creation time) c2pa.thumbnail.ingredient (importing an ingredient) C2PA Embedded File Actions c2pa.actions C2PA CBOR Ingredient c2pa.ingredient C2PA CBOR GDepth Depthmap c2pa.depthmap.GDepth https://developers.google.com/depthmap-metadata/reference CBOR Endorsement cp2a.endorsement C2PA CBOR Exif information stds.exif C2PA JSON-LD IPTC Photo Metadata stds.iptc.photo-metadata C2PA JSON-LD Claim Review stds.schema-org.ClaimReview Schema.org ClaimReview JSON-LD Creative Work stds.schema-org.CreativeWork Schema.org CreativeWork JSON-LD Portion(s) of a non-BMFF-based asset that a claim generator wishes to uniquely identify with a hard binding (i.e., cryptographic hash) shall be described using data hash assertions. The types of hashes which can be created and stored in such an assertion are described in Section 13.1, “Hashing”, and the value shall be present in the hash field. Each data hash assertion defines a specified range of bytes over which the hash has been computed. By default, this range is the entire asset containing this assertion or the entire asset referred to by the url value in the assertion. If only a portion of the asset shall be hashed, then the range(s) to be excluded shall be present in the array value of the exclusions field. The url value provides flexibility for hashing assets that may be represented in multiple chunks or portions, local or remote. A Data Hash assertion shall have a label of c2pa.hash.data. A Data Hash assertion must not appear in a Cloud Data assertion. The CDDL Definition for this type is: ; Also check optionality within the hash-map ; The data structure used to store the cryptographic hash of some or all of the asset's data ; and additional information required to compute the hash. data-hash-map = { ? \"exclusions\": [1* EXCLUSION_RANGE-map], ? \"alg\":tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A string identifying the cryptographic hash algorithm used to compute the hash in this assertion, taken from the C2PA hash algorithm identifier list. If this field is absent, the hash algorithm is taken the `alg` value of the enclosing structure. If both are present, the field in this structure is used. If no value is present in any of these places, this structure is invalid; there is no default. \"hash\": bstr, ; byte string of the hash value \"pad\": bstr, ; zero-filled byte string used for filling up space ? \"pad2\": bstr, ; optional zero-filled byte string used for filling up space ? \"name\": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; (optional) a human-readable description of what this hash cover ? \"url\": uri, ; (optional) a file or http(s) URL to where the bytes that are being hashed can be found. ; This is useful for cases where the data lives in a different file chunk or side-car than the claim. } EXCLUSION_RANGE-map = { \"start\": int, ; Starting byte of the range \"length\": int, ; Number of bytes of data to exclude } An example in CBOR Diagnostic Format (.cbordiag) is shown below: { \"alg\" : \"sha256\", \"pad\" : 'abc', \"hash\": 'Auxjtmax46cC2N3Y9aFmBO9Jfay8LEwJWzBUtZ0sUM8gA=', \"name\": \"JUMBF manifest\" \"exclusions\": [ { \"start\": 9960, \"length\": 4213 } ], } Normally, the start and length values of an exclusion shall be written in their preferred serialization (i.e., \"as short as possible\"). However, when a data hash assertion needs to be created but the start and length values are not yet known, they shall be created \"as large as possible\", which would be as a 32-bit integer. The pad value shall always be present but shall be a zero-filled byte string of length 0 unless used to replace (i.e., \"pad\") bytes during multiple pass processing. pad2 is an optional zero-filled byte string that is used if the desired padding cannot be achieved with pad. Section 10.4, “Multiple Step Processing” describes how to fill in the correct values and adjust the padding. When hashing a JPEG-1 (.jpg) file into which the C2PA Manifest will be embedded, the APP11 marker (FFEB) and the segment’s length (Lp) of all APP11 segments containing the JUMBF data shall be included in the exclusion range. All the APP11 segments containing the C2PA Manifest JUMBF are contiguous so that only a single range is required. When hashing a PNG (.png) file into which the C2PA Manifest will be embedded, it is important that the Length and the 'caBX' (representing the chunk type) of the chunk containing the JUMBF data be included in the exclusion range. Portion(s) of a BMFF-based asset that a claim generator wishes to uniquely identify with a hard binding (i.e., cryptographic hash) shall be described using BMFF-based Hash assertions. A BMFF-based Hash assertion shall have a label of c2pa.hash.bmff for v1 (deprecated) and c2pa.hash.bmff.v2 for v2. A BMFF-based Hash assertion must not appear in a Cloud Data assertion. To compute the hash specified in the value field of a BMFF hash, all bytes of the file are added to the hash excluding those BMFF boxes or subset[s] thereof which match any exclusion entry in the exclusions array. Boxes that are included in their entirety also include their box headers in the input data contributed to the hash. Similarly, boxes that are excluded in their entirety also exclude their box headers from the input data contributed to the hash. When a box is partially excluded from the input data contributed to the hash through the use of a subset field in the exclusion specification, the portion(s) of the box to be excluded defined by the relative byte offsets in the subset field are offsets from the start of the box including the box headers, not offsets from the start of the box’s content. In BMFF-based hash v1, for any root box not excluded in its entirety, the input data contributed to the hash for that box is comprised of data, where data is defined as the box’s contents, including headers, minus any exclusions. In BMFF-based hash v2, for any root box not excluded in its entirety, the input data contributed to the hash for that box is comprised of the concatenation of the binary strings offset || data, where offset is defined as the absolute file offset of the box as an 8-byte integer in big-endian format, and data is defined as the box’s contents, including headers, minus any exclusions. In this definition, \"||\" represents the binary concatenation of the two. There are two differences between BMFF-based hash v1 and v2. The absolute file byte offset is included at the start of the input data contributed to the hash for any root box. This ensures that a root box included in the hash cannot change positions in the file. The mdat box is no longer excluded in its entirety when the bmff-hash-map includes both the hash and merkle fields. Instead, a mandatory entry on the exclusion list excludes most of the box. Along with the first difference, this ensures that the mdat cannot change positions in the file. A box matches an exclusion entry in the exclusions array if and only if all of the following conditions are met. The box’s location in the file exactly matches the exclusions-map entry’s xpath field. If length is specified in the exclusions-map entry, the box’s length exactly matches the exclusions-map entry’s length field. Note: The length includes the box headers. If version is specified in the exclusions-map entry, the box is a FullBox and the box’s version exactly matches the exclusions-map entry’s version field. If flags (byte array of exactly 3 bytes) is specified in the exclusions-map entry and the box is a FullBox. If exact is set to true or not specified, the box’s flags (bit(24), i.e., 3 bytes) also exactly matches the exclusions-map entry’s flags field. If exact is set to false, the bitwise-and of the box’s flags (bit(24), i.e., 3 bytes) with the exclusions-map entry’s flags field exactly matches the exclusions-map entry’s flags field (i.e., the box has at least those bits set but may also have additional bits set). If data (array of objects) is specified in the exclusions-map entry, then for each item in the array, the box’s binary data at that item’s relative byte offset field exactly matches that item’s bytes field. The xpath field’s string syntax shall be limited to the following strict subset. Only abbreviated syntax shall be used. Only full paths shall be used. Only node selection via node or node[integer] shall be used. Descendent syntax, i.e., //, shall NOT be used. All nodes shall be BMFF 4cc codes. Complete Syntax: xpath = '/' nodes nodes = node | node '/' nodes node = box4cc | box4cc '[' integer ']' Where: box4cc is any 4cc allowed by ISO/IEC 14496-12 for a BMFF box. integer is any non-zero positive integer with no leading zeros. A non-leaf xpath node shall only point to a container box that has no fields of its own (i.e., contains no data, only child boxes) and that does not inherit from FullBox. This ensures that a C2PA validator does not need to be aware of the syntax and semantics of unusual boxes that contain other boxes. If a child box of such an unusual box needs to be excluded in full or in part, the exclusions-map entry’s xpath field shall point to the unusual box itself and the subset-map field shall exclude the byte rang(es) containing the excluded child box data. For example, the 'sgpd' box contains other boxes but is unusual in that it inherits from FullBox; as such, if excluding child box(es), in whole or in part, from 'sgpd' is required, the assertion shall use an xpath field pointing to the 'sgpd' itself (e.g., /moof/traf/sgpd) and shall use the subset-map field to exclude the desired bytes. If the C2PA Manifest is embedded into the file, the box containing it shall be one of the entries in the exclusions array. Refer to Section 11.3.2, “Embedding manifests into BMFF-based assets” for more information. If a non-root excluded box is removed after the C2PA Manifest is created, it shall be replaced with a 'free' box of the same size to ensure that the input data contributed to the hash for other boxes are not invalidated. If it is expected that a non-root excluded box may be added after the C2PA Manifest is created, then, at manifest creation time, a 'free' box shall be inserted with sufficient space for the excluded box and that 'free' box shall also be excluded by an exclusion entry using its full xpath. When the excluded box is added, the 'free' box shall be shrunk (or removed) to make space for the added box. Embedding C2PA data into a BMFF-based asset via MP4 boxes changes file offsets in other MP4 boxes and, in v2, the absolute file byte offsets being included in the input data contributed to the hash for any root box. Those boxes and offsets must be included in the input data contributed to the hash with their post-embed values, not their pre-embed values, or the BMFF-based Hash assertion will not validate. Here are two possible ways an implementation can ensure that post-embed values for all file byte offsets are hashed. Use 'free' boxes. Determine reasonable maximum size(s) for the C2PA box(es) which will be embedded. All MP4 boxes for C2PA support unused padding bytes at the end, so it is fine to overestimate the size for the 'free' boxes because any extra bytes will be ignored. Insert 'free' box(es) of said size(s) into the asset file(s) and update all offsets appropriately. Perform hashing of the asset with \"/free\" on the exclusion list. Create and sign the manifest. Create the C2PA box(es). Overwrite the 'free' box(es) with the C2PA box(es). Use a two-pass approach. Compute the exact sizes of the BMFF-based Hash assertion and the merkle box(es) if any. The latter will require parsing the asset file(s) to determine the size of the Merkle tree. Compute the exact size of the final manifest. Perform hashing of the asset file(s). Update any box that includes any file offsets to correct values before including that box in the input data contributed to the hash. In v2, compute the input data contributed to the hash using (offset || data) using the updated absolute file offset as described above. Create and sign the manifest. Create the C2PA box(es). Insert the C2PA box(es). While the latter method is significantly more complex, it does enable correct hashing without any foreknowledge of the maximum manifest size. It also minimizes the final asset’s size. Common boxes (not exhaustive) with file offsets include 'iloc', 'stco', 'co64', 'tfhd', 'sidx', and 'saio'.

This is also true when an existing asset is used to create a derived asset or asset rendition. An Ingredient assertion shall have a label of c2pa.ingredient. Since there will most likely be more than one ingredient assertion, the use of the monotonically increasing index in the label would be used (e.g., c2pa.ingredient__1, c2pa.ingredient__2). The concept of ingredients in C2PA is modelled on the XMP Ingredient and Pantry model, as described in the Partner Guide to XMP for Dynamic Media and Asset Relationships in XMP. That model relies on the fact that each asset used in the construction of a document has, at the time of inclusion, at least one unique identifier. If the ingredient being added contains XMP, then the asset’s xmpMM:DocumentID becomes the documentID field while the xmpMM:InstanceID becomes the instanceID. However, if the ingredient being added does not have any associated XMP, then it may be possible for the XMP to be created and added to the ingredient itself and the identifiers used as described above. When it is not possible or desirable to create XMP for an ingredient, then some other unique identifier for the ingredient shall be used instead for the required values. In this situation, the instanceID field shall contain the unique identifier and the documentID field shall not be present. When adding an ingredient, its relationship to the current asset shall be described. These are the possible values of the relationship field and their meanings: Value Meaning parentOf The current asset is a derived asset or asset rendition of this ingredient. This relationship value is also used with update manifests. componentOf The current asset is composed of multiple parts, this ingredient being one of them. The value of dc:title shall be a human-readable name for the ingredient, which may be taken either from the asset’s XMP or the asset’s name in a local or remote (e.g., cloud-based) filesystem. The Media Type of the ingredient shall be declared in dc:format. The CDDL Definition for this type is: ;Assertion that describes an ingredient used in the asset ingredient-map = { \"dc:title\": tstr, ; name of the ingredient \"dc:format\": format-string, ; Media Type of the ingredient ? \"documentID\": tstr, ; value of the ingredient's `xmpMM:DocumentID` \"instanceID\": tstr, ; unique identifier, such as the value of the ingredient's `xmpMM:InstanceID` \"relationship\": $relation-choice, ; The relationship of this ingredient to the asset it is an ingredient of. ; For example, if an ingredient with a 'parentOf' relationship is added to ; an asset, then the asserter is stating that the current asset is a derived asset of the ingredient. ? \"c2pa_manifest\": $hashed-uri-map, ; hashed_uri reference to the C2PA Manifest of the ingredient ? \"thumbnail\": $hashed-uri-map, ; hashed_uri reference to an ingredient thumbnail ? \"validationStatus\": [1* $status-map] ; validation status of the ingredient ? \"metadata\": $assertion-metadata-map ; additional information about the assertion } format-string = tstr .regexp \"^\\\\w+\\/[-+.\\\\w]+$\" ; Assertion that describes an ingredient used in the asset $relation-choice /= \"parentOf\" $relation-choice /= \"componentOf\" ; Success codes $status-code /= \"claimSignature.validated\" $status-code /= \"signingCredential.trusted\" $status-code /= \"timeStamp.trusted\" $status-code /= \"assertion.hashedURI.match\" $status-code /= \"assertion.dataHash.match\" $status-code /= \"assertion.bmffHash.match\" $status-code /= \"assertion.accessible\" ; Failure codes $status-code /= \"claim.missing\" $status-code /= \"claim.multiple\" $status-code /= \"claim.hardBindings.missing\" $status-code /= \"claim.required.missing\" $status-code /= \"claim.cbor.invalid\" $status-code /= \"ingredient.hashedURI.mismatch\" $status-code /= \"claimSignature.missing\" $status-code /= \"claimSignature.mismatch\" $status-code /= \"manifest.multipleParents\" $status-code /= \"manifest.update.invalid\" $status-code /= \"manifest.update.wrongParents\" $status-code /= \"signingCredential.untrusted\" $status-code /= \"signingCredential.invalid\" $status-code /= \"signingCredential.revoked\" $status-code /= \"signingCredential.expired\" $status-code /= \"timeStamp.mismatch\" $status-code /= \"timeStamp.untrusted\" $status-code /= \"timeStamp.outsideValidity\" $status-code /= \"assertion.hashedURI.mismatch\" $status-code /= \"assertion.missing\" $status-code /= \"assertion.multipleHardBindings\" $status-code /= \"assertion.undeclared\" $status-code /= \"assertion.inaccessible\" $status-code /= \"assertion.notRedacted\" $status-code /= \"assertion.selfRedacted\" $status-code /= \"assertion.required.missing\" $status-code /= \"assertion.json.invalid\" $status-code /= \"assertion.cbor.invalid\" $status-code /= \"assertion.action.ingredientMismatch\" $status-code /= \"assertion.action.redacted\" $status-code /= \"assertion.dataHash.mismatch\" $status-code /= \"assertion.bmffHash.mismatch\" $status-code /= \"assertion.cloud-data.hardBinding\" $status-code /= \"assertion.cloud-data.actions\" $status-code /= \"algorithm.unsupported\" $status-code /= \"general.error\" ; when nothing else applies status-map = { \"code\": $status-code, ; A label-formatted string that describes the status ? \"url\": url-regexp-type, ; JUMBF URI reference ? \"explanation\": tstr .size (1..max-tstr-length), ; A human readable string explaining the status ? \"success\": bool ; does the code reflect success (true) or failure (false) } An example in CBOR Diagnostic Format (.cbordiag) is shown below: { \"dc:title\": \"image 1.jpg\", \"metadata\": { \"dateTime\": 0(\"2021-06-28T16:49:32.874Z\"), \"reviewRating\": [ { \"value\": 5, \"explanation\": \"Content bindings validated\" } ] } \"dc:format\": \"image/jpeg\", \"thumbnail\" : { \"url\": \"self#jumbf=cp2a/urn:uuid:F9168C5E-CEB2-4faa-B6BF-329BF39FA1E4/c2pa.thumbnail.ingredient_1.jpg\", \"hash\": b64'UjRAYWiAq4lfCRDmksWAlDJN/XtHHFFwMWymsZsm3j8=' }, \"documentID\" : \"uuid:87d51599-286e-43b2-9478-88c79f49c347\", \"instanceID\" : \"uuid:7b57930e-2f23-47fc-affe-0400d70b738d\", \"relationship\": \"parentOf\", \"c2pa_manifest\" : { \"url\": \"self#jumbf=c2pa/urn:uuid:5E7B01FC-4932-4BAB-AB32-D4F12A8AA322\", \"hash\": b64'1kjJTO108b71cL95UxgfHD3eDgk9VrCedW8n3fYTRMk=' }, } When adding an ingredient, it may be useful to also include a thumbnail of the ingredient to help establish the state of the ingredient at the time of import. For that purpose, an ingredient import thumbnail should be added as described in Section 18.9, “Thumbnail” and referenced herein via a URI reference. If the ingredient has an existing C2PA Manifest Store, then all C2PA Manifests in the store (both standard and updates) shall be copied into the C2PA Manifest Store for the asset. The URI reference to the ingredient’s active C2PA Manifest shall be stored as the value of c2pa_manifest. In addition, it is recommended that the C2PA validator validate the ingredient’s active C2PA Manifest and document the validation status in the validationStatus field. When present, the value of the validationStatus field shall contain at least one entry in the array. Each object in the validationStatus array consists of a code value that describes the validation status of a specific part of the manifest along with an optional success boolean value representing if the code reflect success (true) or failure (false). A optional url field with a JUMBF URI reference to that element in the manifest may be present. Depending on the code, the url could be to a claim, a claim signature or a specific assertion. An optional description of the validation status may be present in the explanation field if there is a need for an additional human readable explanation. Custom status codes are also permitted, when a claim generator has a need to record some process-specific status information. The code shall conform to the same syntax as custom labels, e.g. com.litware and the validationStatus object shall contain a success boolean. Status codes are defined in Section 15.1, “Status Codes”. A Depthmap assertion provides a 3D description of the scene being captured by a camera. A Depthmap assertion may contain a pre-computed depth map, or data which can later be used to compute a depth map by downstream ingestion or viewing software (e.g., left/right stereo images). All Depthmap assertions shall have a label that starts with c2pa.depthmap and be followed by a third section that identifies the type of depth map. C2PA Depthmap assertions shall be captured optically, not inferred from a single 2D image via, for example, a machine learning model. A GDepth depth map assertion leverages the well-established GDepth format to encode a pre-computed depth map. A GDepth Depthmap assertion shall have a label of c2pa.depthmap.GDepth. The schema for the data stored in this assertion should always mirror the schema at https://developers.google.com/depthmap-metadata/reference. There is no need to worry about splitting up the GDepth data when it grows beyond 64KB, as that limit existed in XMP to accommodate APP1 segment size limitations. The CDDL Definition for this type is: ; Assertion that encodes a GDepth-formatted 3D depth map of the captured scene depthmap-gdepth-map = { \"GDepth:Format\": format-type, ; The format that describes how to convert the depthmap data into a valid float-point depthmap.

The Endorsement assertion is where an endorsement from the signer of an ingredient asset is stored. These endorsements are typically provided (out-of-band of this specification) by ingredient asset signers to actors those signers trust to perform the actions listed in [_action_endorsement]. They are used by a validator when assessing whether the actions of the active manifest are \"endorsed\" or not (see endorsement validation). To attach an endorsement, a claim generator must ensure that: only the actions listed in the [_action_endorsement] section are present in the actions assertion exactly one ingredient assertion is present in the assertion store, and, that ingredient is the one referenced by the actions assertion’s parameters.ingredient field An Endorsement assertion shall have a label of c2pa.endorsement, and there shall be at most one Endorsement assertion per manifest. The assertion contents shall be a COSE_Sign1_Tagged structure that is created as defined in Section 14.7.1, “Endorsement Generation”. The Exif Information assertion can be used to ensure that Exif information, for example about the capture device, is added to the asset in a way that can be validated cryptographically. It is preferable to copy this information from the Exif block or from the Exif namespace of the XMP block. Information should be copied to JSON-LD using the XMP field names specified in the Exif 2.32 metadata for XMP specification. When copying the information from XMP, the data shall be re-serialized according to the rules of the JSON-LD serialization of XMP. An Exif Information assertion shall have a label of stds.exif. Any property from the latest version of the Exif specification (currently 2.32) can be added to the stds.exif assertion, with the exception of the MakerNote (37500, 0x927c) field, the contents of which are vendor-specific. This assertion should be used to assert the precise location associated with the content using the Exif GPS properties (those starting exif:GPS). For broad information about the location, see Section 18.15, “IPTC Photo Metadata”. An example of an Exif Information assertion: { \"@context\" : { \"dc\": \"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\", \"exifEX\": \"http://cipa.jp/exif/2.32/\", \"exif\": \"http://ns.adobe.com/exif/1.0/\", \"tiff\": \"http://ns.adobe.com/tiff/1.0/\", \"xmp\": \"http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/\", \"rdf\": \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\" }, \"exif:GPSVersionID\": \"2.2.0.0\", \"exif:GPSLatitude\": \"39,21.102N\", \"exif:GPSLongitude\": \"74,26.5737W\", \"exif:GPSAltitudeRef\": 0, \"exif:GPSAltitude\": \"100963/29890\", \"exif:GPSTimeStamp\": \"2019-09-22T18:22:57Z\", \"exif:GPSSpeedRef\": \"K\", \"exif:GPSSpeed\": \"4009/161323\", \"exif:GPSImgDirectionRef\": \"T\", \"exif:GPSImgDirection\": \"296140/911\", \"exif:GPSDestBearingRef\": \"T\", \"exif:GPSDestBearing\": \"296140/911\", \"exif:GPSHPositioningError\": \"13244/2207\", \"exif:ExposureTime\": \"1/100\", \"exif:FNumber\": 4.0, \"exif:ColorSpace\": 1, \"exif:DigitalZoomRatio\": 2.0, \"tiff:Make\": \"CameraCompany\", \"tiff:Model\": \"Shooter S1\", \"exifEX:LensMake\": \"CameraCompany\", \"exifEX:LensModel\": \"17.0-35.0 mm\", \"exifEX:LensSpecification\": { \"@list\": [ 1.55, 4.2, 1.6, 2.4 ] } } Although the redaction process works in such a way that only an entire assertion can be redacted (see Section 6.7, “Redaction of Assertions”), the use of an update manifest enables partial redaction by removing the original and then placing the new, reduced, versions in the update manifest. This new assertion would be presented in a user experience in association with the signer of the update manifest and not with the signer of the C2PA Manifest that has been redacted. For example, an assertion containing both location data and camera information which may need to have the location data redacted which could be done through an update manifest with a new stds.exif assertion with only the camera information. The International Press Telecommunications Council defines a standard set of descriptive, administrative and rights metadata typically used by photographers, distributors, news organizations, archivists, and developers. Early versions of the standard used IPTC’s binary Information Interchange Model (IPTC-IIM) format and later versions introduced XMP support for all IIM fields, plus a new set of fields which can only be expressed in XMP. Together, these are called the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard. The IPTC Photo Metadata assertion can be used to ensure that IPTC Photo Metadata, for example describing ownership, rights and descriptive metadata about an image, is added to the asset in a way that can be validated cryptographically. It is preferable to copy this information from the IPTC-IIM or XMP block. Information should be copied to JSON-LD using the XMP field names specified in the Exif 2.32 metadata for XMP specification. When copying the information from XMP, the data shall be re-serialized according to the rules of the JSON-LD serialization of XMP. IPTC Photo Metadata properties can be copied to the C2PA assertion store as an assertion with the label stds.iptc.photo-metadata. The data should be in JSON-LD format using the XMP field names and structures specified in the IPTC Photo Metadata Specification. Any property from the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard can be added to the stds.iptc.photo-metadata assertion. In particular, the Location Created property can be used to assert the broad location associated with an asset. To assert the precise GPS location associated with an asset, the Exif information assertion should be used. An example of an IPTC Photo Metadata assertion including location information: { \"@context\" : { \"Iptc4xmpCore\": \"http://iptc.org/std/Iptc4xmpCore/1.0/xmlns/\", \"Iptc4xmpExt\": \"http://iptc.org/std/Iptc4xmpExt/2008-02-29/\", \"dc\" : \"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\", \"photoshop\" : \"http://ns.adobe.com/photoshop/1.0/\", \"plus\" : \"http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/xmp/1.0/\", \"xmp\" : \"http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/\", \"xmpRights\" : \"http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/rights/\" }, \"photoshop:DateCreated\": \"Aug 31, 2022\", (1) \"dc:creator\": [ \"Julie Smith\" ], (2) \"dc:rights\": \"Copyright (C) 2022 Example Photo Agency.

User Experiences would present this new assertion with the signer of the update manifest and not with the signer of the C2PA Manifest that has been redacted. For example, an assertion containing location properties, creator name and other information may need to have the creator name redacted which could be done through an update manifest with a new stds.iptc.photo-metadata assertion with the other information still present. Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet. As such, they provide numerous JSON-based grammars that one may wish to include as an assertion. When using a schema.org type as a C2PA assertion, we require a full JSON-LD serialisation. Thus, the top-level @context field must have a value of http://schema.org. All Schema.org assertions shall have a label that starts with schema.org and be followed by the name of the schema that is being used. For example, schema.org.ImageObject can be used to include something extra about an image. Since schemas on Schema.org are not versioned as described here, no version indicator is used in their labels. A schema that is used by the publishing community for web sites has recently also been introduced for images. A ClaimReview is used as 'A fact-checking review of claims made (or reported) in some creative work (referenced via itemReviewed).' A ClaimReview assertion shall have a label of stds.schema-org.ClaimReview. Inside the assertion (which, as described previously, is serialised as JSON-LD), the top-level @type field should be set to a value of ClaimReview. The \"Claim\" in ClaimReview refers to a \"claim made (or reported) in some creative work\", not the C2PA claim. ClaimReview assertions can be used as a way to mark the current asset as a review of the claims of another work, not any specific part of the C2PA manifest. To provide a review of a specific assertion, use an assertion metadata assertion. As an example: an image infographic has been assembled that fact-checks some other claim that is currently in public distribution. The image infographic includes a ClaimReview assertion which references the text of the claim its reviewing, a fact-checking rating of the claim, and zero to many links to other works (e.g., articles, videos, images) that are making that claim. The reviewRating property inside the ClaimReview assertion is of type Rating. Depending on how an organisation does fact-checking reviews, it may have a numerical rating, a true or false, or some other textual description of how the asset has reviewed a claim. https://www.claimreviewproject.com/user-guide provides a good guide on how to use the ClaimReview vocabulary. The reviewRating property in a ClaimReview is not the same as the reviewRatings field in the assertion metadata. A partial JSON Schema for this type is: This schema does not validate all aspects of the referenced schema.org types (just the top-level ClaimReview and Review properties). Please refer to https://schema.org for the details on referenced types, and https://json-ld.org/ for how to reference them in the assertion. { \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema\", \"$id\": \"http://ns.c2pa.org/claim_review/v1\", \"type\": \"object\", \"description\": \"Assertion that describes a fact-checking review of claims made (or reported) in some creative work (referenced via itemReviewed).\", \"examples\": [ { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ClaimReview\", \"claimReviewed\": \"The world is flat\", \"reviewRating\": { \"@type\": \"Rating\", \"ratingValue\": \"1\", \"bestRating\": \"5\", \"worstRating\": \"1\", \"ratingExplanation\": \"The world is not flat\", \"alternateName\": \"False\" }, \"itemReviewed\": { \"@type\": \"CreativeWork\", \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"A N Other\" }, \"headline\": \"Earth: Flat.\" } } ], \"anyOf\": [ { \"$ref\": \"https://json.schemastore.org/schema-org-thing.json\" } ], \"properties\": { \"claimReviewed\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"minLength\": 1, \"description\": \"A short summary of the specific claims reviewed in a ClaimReview.\" }, \"reviewAspect\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"minLength\": 1, \"description\": \"From http://schema.org/Review: This Review or Rating is relevant to this part or facet of the itemReviewed.\" }, \"reviewBody\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"minLength\": 1, \"description\": \"From http://schema.org/Review: The actual body of the review.\" }, \"reviewRating\": { \"description\": \"From http://schema.org/Review: The rating given in this review.

One of the core types is CreativeWork, which is intended to describe any representation of creative effort. This assertion allows an asserter to provide various pieces of information about the asset, including who they are, and the date/time of publication. A Creative Work assertion shall have a label of stds.schema-org.CreativeWork. Inside the assertion (which, as described previously, is serialised as JSON-LD), the top-level @type field should be set to a value of CreativeWork. The JSON-LD document’s root subject is the bound asset of the claim that this assertion is part of. A partial JSON Schema for this type is: This schema does not validate all aspects of the schema.org types, a valid CreativeWork assertion is free to use any types or vocabulary specified by

An actor object references a particular person or organisation. A valid actor object shall have either: an identifier field containing an identifier, or, Since this field is a URL, it is possible to use various identity schemes such as OpenID, WebID or ISNI. a credentials or credential field containing at least one hashed_uri to a W3C Verifiable Credential in the Credential Store that is associated with the actor, or, Most references to a W3C Verifiable Credentials are via a credentials field, the Creative Work assertion uses a credential field in order to align with the schema.org model of singular field names. both (in which case, the id field in the credentialSubject W3C Verifiable Credential object should match the identifier field of the actor). There are a number of open topics that have not yet been addressed in this specification. They are briefly described below, organized by the relevant section of the specification. Support for marking a previous claim or assertion as \"retracted\", a feature commonly used in the news publication industry. Add support for the binding of live video streams, 3D formats and audio formats. Addressing the case where servers make real-time modifications to content streamed to a client, potentially altering the cryptographic hash used to bind ISO BMFF content to a manifest. Determining whether the box exclusion list used for hashing a BMFF-formatted asset in the fragmented MP4 case needs to support having each fragment have its own exclusion list (e.g. if the subset to hash must be fragment-specific). Supporting additional credential types for use in signing manifests. Design for how a video player can communicate with the media validator to indicate that a discontinuity in video playback is expected, perhaps due to seek, fast forward, or other types of \"trick play\". Working with the W3C and browser vendors to define a standardized model for exposing the provenance data to user agents. The C2PA has adopted an open standard patent policy via W3C’s Patent Mode (2004): Licensing Commitment. For materials other than source code or datasets developed by the Working Group, each Working Group Participant agrees to make available any of its Essential Claims, as defined in the W3C Patent Policy (available at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), under the W3C RF licensing requirements Section 5 (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), in Approved Deliverables adopted by that Working Group as if that Approved Deliverable was a W3C Recommendation. Source code developed by the Working Group is subject to the license set forth in the Working Group charter. For Exclusion. Prior to the adoption of a Draft Deliverable as an Approved Deliverable, a Working Group Participant may exclude Essential Claims from its licensing commitments under this agreement by providing written notice of that intent to the Working Group chair (“Exclusion Notice”). The Exclusion Notice for issued patents and published applications must include the patent number(s) or title and application number(s), as the case may be, for each of the issued patent(s) or pending patent application(s) that the Working Group Participant wishes to exclude from the licensing commitment set forth in Section 1 of this patent policy. If an issued patent or pending patent application that may contain Essential Claims is not set forth in the Exclusion Notice, those Essential Claims shall continue to be subject to the licensing commitments under this agreement. The Exclusion Notice for unpublished patent applications must provide either: (i) the text of the filed application; or (ii) identification of the specific part(s) of the Draft Deliverable whose implementation makes the excluded claim an Essential Claim. If (ii) is chosen, the effect of the exclusion will be limited to the identified part(s) of the Draft Deliverable. The Working Group Chair will publish Exclusion Notices.","title":"C2PA Technical Specification","component":"specifications","version":"1.1","name":"C2PA_Specification","url":"/specifications/1.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

General considerations for human rights defenders This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Harms modelling focuses on analysing how a socio-technical system might negatively impact users, stakeholders, broader society, or otherwise create or re-enforce structures of injustice, threats to human rights, or disproportionate risks to vulnerable groups globally. The process of harms modelling systematically requires combining knowledge about a system architecture and its user affordances, with historical and contextual evidence about the impact of similar existing systems on different social groups. This combined information frames the ability to anticipate harm. Harms modelling considers the ramifications of a technological system both from the perspective of the technology developers as well as users and non-user stakeholders. In other words, harms modelling considers what kinds of harms may result from the configuration of a system as well as what kinds of harms may result from both its intended use and unintended use. It is necessary to combine all of these considerations to achieve a broader perspective on potential harms, particularly on those that may be unanticipated by system developers but highly evident to disproportionately impacted social groups. Following principles from justice-oriented technology development and design justice, it is essential to include wide-ranging and ongoing consultations with communities likely to be impacted by the specification, and to place emphasis on those who already face similar systemic harms. In designing our harms modelling approach, the Taskforce drew inspiration from different approaches to technology impact assessment, including the fields of value-driven design, human rights due diligence, security-focused threat modelling frameworks, and harms modelling methodologies. After a review of potential methodologies, it was determined that adapted versions of Microsoft’s Harms Modelling Framework and BSR’s Human Rights Due Diligence Assessment would be used to guide the harms modelling process for C2PA. The Taskforce also collaborated with colleagues conducting parallel exercises in threat modelling exercises as part of the Technical Working Group and engaged with the User Experience research and Decoupled Taskforces within C2PA. Some of the modifications made to existing frameworks for technology impact assessment are listed below: Human rights-focused harm taxonomy The Taskforce sought to ensure that more well-established human rights, privacy and security concerns were analysed as elements of broader forms of harm around social inequality and discrimination, and in relation to issues potentially affecting the particular users and stakeholders of the C2PA (such as media entities, citizen journalists, and human rights defenders). For this reason, the harm taxonomy particular to the Microsoft Harms Modelling Framework was modified to reflect these issue intersections, stakeholders, and users. The reader will note that some harm taxonomy categories are broader than others. This reflects the fact that there is significant overlap between categories and using both broad and narrow categories helped to consider a range of potential harms, misuses and abuses. Temporality It is important to analyze harms and impacts not as a static snapshot in time but as an ongoing process with particular considerations for every stage of technological design, development and use (and potentially non-use). This is reflected in the following scenarios of analysis: 1) Initial Adoption; 2) Wide Adoption and 3) Ongoing Maintenance. These scenarios are explained further in the Harms, Misuse, and Abuse Initial Assessment section. Assigning values for severity, scale, likelihood, frequency and impact The Taskforce conducted an internal process to understand severity, scale, likelihood, frequency and impact of potential harms. This was done in consultation with issue experts within the C2PA and based on C2PA member WITNESS’s work and consultation globally on trade-offs and risks within authenticity and provenance infrastructure (see Ticks or It Didn’t Happen: Confronting Key Dilemmas in Building Authenticity Infrastructure for Multimedia). Further consultation followed with outside groups, particularly with communities with lived, practical and expert knowledge, and with those who may be disproportionately impacted by potential harms and that are often most excluded from design. This analysis will be be ongoing, considering that the degree of severity, likelihood, and impact will likely change and become more evident after the specifications are implemented into products and deployed. Considering accountability Acknowledging that ethical analyses and threat modelling processes are sometimes done behind closed doors, it is important to emphasize that the harm assessment will be continuously inclusive and it will inform future specifications development, the governance of the coalition, potential parallel compliance mechanisms, and cooperation and resourcing for a diverse C2PA ecosystem. There are three phases to our methodology. These phases do not reflect a chronological order, they frame specific processes that will need to be continuously iterated as more actors join the discussion and analysis, both before and after the publication of version 1.0. Phase I includes defining the purposes of the technology, its use-cases and stakeholders as it pertains to the harms, misuse and abuse assessment. As with other parts of the C2PA standards development, the Taskforce began with the Purposes/Use-Cases/Users/Stakeholders from two initiatives, the Content Authenticity Initiative and Project Origin and expanded to other potential scenarios. Some of the questions to be addressed were: Purposes What problem will be solved? For who? What new capability will be possible? For who? Use-cases What will the C2PA standard be used for? What context will the C2PA standard likely be used in? Users/Actors Who will directly interact with the C2PA standard? Stakeholders Who will be impacted by the use of the C2PA standard including non-users? In Phase II, the Taskforce reviewed and adapted Microsoft’s taxonomy of harm to better reflect the context and implications of the C2PA specifications. This process was intertwined with the actual assessment of the identified harms. The guiding questions in this phase were: How could people be harmed by the use of C2PA? What use-cases are most likely to cause harm? To whom? What use-cases are most likely to cause harm? To whom? How could a misuse or abuse of C2PA lead to harm? Who would be affected? What contextual evidence from either an existing technology or societal phenomenon either provides direct evidence of this harm or harm in a related context? What is the severity, scale, frequency, likelihood, and disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups of a particular potential harm? Phase III was aimed at mitigating potential abuse and misuse, and offering considerations and guidelines for the protection of human rights and for the optimization of the benefits that prompted the development of the C2PA standard. The questions that guided us in this phase were: How could the C2PA specifications be designed to prevent harmful impacts? How could the C2PA specifications be built to protect human rights? What guidance, compliance requirements or technical steps can address these? Answers to these questions are reflected in the due diligence strategy that affects the specifications and its accompanying documents, which includes guidance for implementers, guidance on user experience, security considerations, and an explainer aimed at the general public. Due diligence recommendations resulting from the harm assessment should also inform the governance of the Coalition and guide potential multilateral cooperation for the promotion of a diverse C2PA ecosystem that pushes for the optimization of the benefits in terms of trust in media, user control and transparency that prompted the development of the C2PA specifications. The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment is an ongoing process. The information presented in the Harms Modelling documentation should not be considered the end result of a comprehensive evaluation, but as a basis for ongoing discussions centred on impacted communities, and aimed at mitigating potential abuse and misuse and protecting human rights. There are two critical aspects of the approach: Ongoing The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment necessarily accompanies the design and development, as well as implementation and use-stages of the C2PA by continuously informing the specifications development process, the implementation and user-experience guides, sensitization efforts, the governance of the Coalition and potentially multilateral cooperation for the promotion of a diverse C2PA ecosystem that serves a broad range of global contexts. Multi-disciplinary and diverse The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment is a collaborative effort that includes multi-disciplinary experts and a broad range of stakeholders with lived, practical and technical experience of the issues and from diverse geographical locations, cultural backgrounds and individual identities. For more information on purposes and use-cases of the C2PA specifications, see the examples listed in the Explainer. Note that this is not an exhaustive list, but an extension of use-cases that have come up in parallel organizations such as the Content Authenticity Initiative and Project Origin, as well as the particular experiences of C2PA members. For more information on users, see the Expected Users in the Guiding Principles. Note that this list is not intended to limit consideration of other interested parties. It is worth noting that the potential harms identified reflect system-level considerations that may not be relevant for all products using these specifications. In an effort to establish a common basis for an analysis and to guide internal and now public discussions, the Taskforce proposes some scenarios based on three temporal stages of the development and adoption cycle of the C2PA standard. Scenario 1: Initial Adoption For this scenario, it is assumed that the tool will be deployed by a few key actors across multiple industries. These actors will be primarily, though not exclusively, members of the C2PA. Some of these early adopters are actors with significant influence over their respective industries, and it is assumed that their example and reach could lead to a scenario of wide adoption. Scenario 2: Wide Adoption It is assumed for this scenario that the C2PA standard could be widely used at a global scale, and that it will be a credible reference of the authenticity and provenance of digital assets. In this scenario, it would be more widely used in social media platforms, by a diversity of media producers and be discussed in legislation or regulation. Despite its widespread use, there would continue to be many actors across different industries, vulnerable groups and geographic locations that do not or cannot use the specifications. Scenario 3: Ongoing maintenance This scenario crosscuts through the previous two, and reflects the issue of continuous improvement and adaptation of the specification as a response to a dynamic context and threat landscape. The table presented here lists the potential harms identified and classifies them under their respective category and type of harm. The results of the assessment reflect considerations from Scenario 1: Initial adoption. Identified Harms A PDF containing the detailed harms that have been identified and their severity levels can be found here. Note that the identified mitigations are listed in a separate document that is linked to under the 'Due Diligence Actions' section below. Three levels of due diligence actions have been identified: Specifications development The specifications should reflect considerations from the harms, misuse and abuse assessment, as outlined in the Guiding Principles. Accompanying documentation The accompanying documentation should reflect considerations from the harms, misuse and abuse assessment. The documentation includes: Guidance for implementers; Guidance on user experience; Security considerations; Explainer aimed for the general public. Non-technical and multilateral harms response actions The harms, misuse and abuse assessment has also highlighted the need for continuously monitoring the impact of the specifications, for developing mechanisms to reflect an evolving landscape and addressing unidentified and unmitigated threats and harms. Other areas for due diligence actions include: Multilateral cooperation for the promotion of a diverse C2PA ecosystem, including efforts to resource public-interest implementations; Sensitization of the specifications to a broad base of users and stakeholders; Promote parallel efforts to ensure compliance around C2PA specs-enabled products Recognizing the limitations and biases of C2PA members and to ensure feedback on harms, misuse and abuse scenarios and responses, the Threats and Harms Taskforce has engaged in a focused effort to solicit input from people and groups across the globe that may consider themselves likely to be impacted by the implementation of these specifications. This feedback has centred on communities with lived, practical, professional and technical experience of the impact of similar technologies, as well as communities that are often excluded from technology design and implementation decision-making while also being the most likely to experience potential harms. Some of the areas covered in these sessions included understanding the potential impact of C2PA specifications on efforts to defend and protect human rights, uphold digital and economic rights, combat mis/disinformation, support civic/community/independent media, and more generally, its impact on social and democratic structures. The table presented here lists existing and potential mitigations to each of the potential harms identified to date. These mitigations reflect the specifications and its accompanying documents as they are at the moment of their version 1.0 publication. They also include recommendations for non-technical and multilateral harms response actions that will be developed further to reflect findings from the ongoing harms, misuse and abuse assessment. Note that for a summary of relevant security features, considerations, and for a threats assessment and countermeasures, see Security Considerations Actions A PDF containing the due diligence actions can be found here. As part of due diligence, we offer the following considerations for key stakeholders of the C2PA specifications. The harms considerations below do not include risks from security threats (e.g. attackers aiming to compromise the security of the system). For more information on the threat modeling process see the Security Considerations. C2PA manifests may be used by content creators to provide cryptographically verifiable provenance information for various reasons, including, but not limited to, safeguarding authorship or providing additional signals of trust. The harms, misuse, and abuse assessment laid out in this document have identified a list of potential harms, some of which may impact content creators. In order to avert and mitigate these potential harms, this assessment has informed and will continue to inform the development of the specifications. It is important to note, however, given the vast diversity of usages, stakeholders, and industries that the C2PA specifications could enable, that all identified potential harms may not be addressed at this level, but will need to be taken up by implementers in consideration of their specific circumstances, users and stakeholders. As of the current version of the specifications, the C2PA issues the following harms considerations for content creators. Technical Accessibility Considerations Implementing the C2PA specifications (creating C2PA-enabled tools) The specifications are open, global, and opt-in, and they use open standards for which there are existing libraries in various programming languages across a range of devices and operating systems/environments in order to facilitate the development of tools that can meet the needs of a diverse group of users. In other words, the Technical Working Group of the C2PA understands that, as of version 1.1 of the specifications, there are no technical barriers to the creation of C2PA-enabled tools and services that meet the needs of a diverse group of users, including those that may be using older devices and operating systems, or others that may have a poor internet connection. The C2PA has also published a guide for implementers that will be continuously updated in order to facilitate a C2PA ecosystem that reflects a broad spectrum of needs and circumstances. Using C2PA enabled tools and software The decisions of implementors of the specifications may still hinder the use of C2PA-enabled technologies where they are needed the most. For example, there is the possibility that C2PA claim generators will not operate in pirated software. Additionally, some specification-compliant implementations may prefer to add restrictions to their use. For example, a tool may restrict its use to only newer devices or operating systems, despite the recommendations listed in the Guidance for implementers. To address accessibility concerns related to the use of C2PA enabled tools and software, it is necessary to promote a diverse C2PA ecosystem that caters to all user groups throughout the world. To this end, the C2PA seeks to cooperate with implementers to work towards effective global accessibility for content creators and consumers. Privacy and security considerations The following potential harms may still occur in specific implementations of the C2PA specifications: Inadvertent disclosure of information: C2PA claim generators may automatically add, or require to add, information to manifests that may be sensitive. Specification-compliant implementations may intentionally or unintentionally hide this feature. User experience guidance has been published alongside the specs to offer a clear acknowledgement of creator consent before a C2PA implementation can begin accumulating data. Redacted (deleted) information from C2PA manifests may still be accessible: If a soft binding lookup is enabled or required by manifest stores, then previous versions of a manifest with sensitive information may be located. The use of C2PA-enabled tools and services in adverse legal or political situations may result in human rights violations: The C2PA specifications include features to protect the privacy of users, but this does not preclude the possibility of malicious actors, including potentially state actors, misusing or abusing the system. The C2PA specifications do not provide value judgments about the truth or falsehood of digital assets. In other words, the presence of valid manifests does not mean that anything is ‘true’; validated manifests only establish whether the provenance information can be verified as associated with the underlying asset, correctly formed, and free from tampering. As of version 1.1 of the specifications, the C2PA issues the following comments and considerations for content consumers: Digital assets, such as images and videos, can have valid C2PA manifests and still be deemed to be mis or disinformation. Content consumers should note that the verification of an active manifest includes validating the signature. An invalid manifest cannot be associated with the signer. The fact that any digital asset does not have C2PA manifests does not mean that its contents are not to be trusted. This may be especially relevant to note in a scenario where these specifications are widely adopted. In other words, it is important to know that there may be content creators who will have legitimate reasons to not use C2PA enabled tools and services, and their content should not be dismissed or undermined for not being connected to a C2PA manifest. An invalid C2PA manifest could mean that either the digital content or the manifest has been tampered with, though this may not always be the case. The User Experience Guidance is being designed to define best practices for presenting C2PA provenance to consumers. The recommendations strive to describe standard, readily recognizable experiences that provide asset consumers information and history about the content they are consuming, thereby empowering them to understand where it came from and decide how much to trust it. If a content consumer trusts a particular signer, then they may be inclined to believe that the information provided in the manifest is authentic. In other words, a preexisting relationship of trust between a signer and a content consumer is the basis of the C2PA trust model. C2PA specifications are designed to provide signals for content consumers to know that the signer is in fact who they say they are and that the manifest is in fact connected to a particular asset. The harms, misuse and abuse assessment laid out in this document identifies a list of potential harms, some of which may impact civic, community and independent media. In order to avert and mitigate these potential harms, this assessment has informed and will continue to inform the development of the specifications. It is important to note, however, given the vast diversity of usages, stakeholders, and industries that the C2PA specifications could enable, that all identified potential harms may not be addressed at this level, but will need to be taken up by implementers in consideration of their specific circumstances, users and stakeholders. Technical Accessibility considerations As of version 1.1 of the specifications, the C2PA issues the following harms considerations for civic, community, and independent media that may be interested in 1. creating their own C2PA-enabled tool, 2. in becoming a signer, or 3. in simply using C2PA-enabled tools. Implementing the C2PA specifications (creating C2PA-enabled tools) In order to guarantee accessibility, privacy, and security criteria, civic, community, and independent media may be interested in creating their own C2PA-enabled tools. In this case, although there are technical and financial requirements to be considered, it is worth noting that the specifications have been designed to facilitate implementations to the extent possible: The specifications are open, global, and opt-in, and they use open standards for which there are existing libraries in various programming languages across a range of devices and operating systems/environments in order to facilitate the development of tools that can meet the needs of a diverse group of users. That said, the C2PA seeks to cooperate with implementers, partners and other stakeholders in order to promote a diverse ecosystem that caters to all user groups throughout the world, including those that actively strive to guarantee accessibility, privacy and security criteria. The C2PA has also published a guide for implementers that will be continuously updated in order to facilitate a C2PA ecosystem that reflects a broad spectrum of needs and circumstances. Becoming a signer Civic, community, and independent media may be interested in becoming signers in order to have their brand vouching for manifests tied to the digital assets they create and share. By becoming signers, civic, community, and independent media would also be able to determine what information (assertions) are included in the manifests generated. There are two ways of becoming a signer: either by using credentials issued by a CA or by self-signing manifests. C2PA manifests currently makes use of X.509 certificates which allow for independent verification of your identity, thereby adding a layer of trust to the signed manifests. However, the X.509 certificates come at a cost that may not be accessible to all. For those that self-sign a provenance claim, they should note that these may be deemed to be less credible since the certificate is not independently verified. In some countries, governments may issue digital certificates to all of its citizens. These certificates could be potentially used to sign C2PA manifests. If government control and surveillance is not regulated, or if there are laws meant to attach journalistic identity to media posted online, these certificates may be used to enforce suppression of speech or to persecute journalists if required by claim generators that do not guarantee privacy and confidentiality. Similarly, certain C2PA claim generators may allow content creators, including civic, community and indepente media, to sign manifests with their personal certificates associated with their IDs. Although guidance to allow for anonymity and pseudonymity has been issued, specification-compliant tools may sell information to third-parties, or not follow user experience guidance meant to empower users to retain control of their information. Using C2PA enabled tools and software C2PA manifests may be used by the civic, community, and independent media to provide cryptographically verifiable provenance information for various reasons, including, but not limited to, safeguarding authorship or providing additional signals of trust. Technical restraints at the specifications level may still hinder the use of C2PA-enabled technologies where they are needed the most. For example, it is expected that C2PA claim generators will not operate in pirated software. Additionally, some specification-compliant implementations may prefer to add restrictions to their use. For example, a tool may restrict its use to only newer devices or operating systems, despite the recommendations listed in the Guidance for Implementers. To address accessibility concerns related to the use of C2PA enabled tools and software, it is necessary to promote a diverse C2PA ecosystem that caters to all user groups throughout the world. To this end, the C2PA seeks to cooperate with implementers to work towards effective global accessibility for content creators. Privacy and security considerations for civic, community and independent media The following potential harms may still occur in specific implementations of the C2PA specifications: Inadvertent disclosure of information: C2PA claim generators may automatically add, or require to add, information to manifests that may be sensitive. Specification-compliant implementations may intentionally or unintentionally hide this feature. Redacted (deleted) information from C2PA manifests may still be accessible: If soft binding lookup is enabled or required by manifest stores, then previous versions of a manifest with sensitive information may be located. The use of C2PA-enabled tools and services in adverse legal or political situations may result in human rights violations: The C2PA specifications include features to protect the privacy of users, but this does not preclude the possibility of malicious actors, including potentially state actors, to misuse or abuse the system. Other considerations for civic, community, and independent media* Media and news outlets may face additional pressure to authenticate media, both in terms of ensuring media they are sourcing from stringers, ingesting into their archives, and producing and publishing in-house is resilient to falsifications, and in terms of assessing user-generated content, they include in their reporting. The additional resources required to authenticate media may preclude participation. Video captured by eyewitnesses and on-the-ground human rights activists can be instrumental in drawing attention to human rights violations, supporting calls for policy change, and pushing for accountability. The C2PA, its implementations, and the broader provenance and authenticity ecosystem could have both positive and negative effects on the way that visual or audiovisual evidence of human rights violations are captured and used. On the one hand, digital assets embedded with manifests could help add a layer of trust so that evidence of human rights violations are not as easily dismissed or undermined. This could be more relevant now and in the future as technologies to create synthetic media are improved, further blurring the divide between what is real and fake. To name an example, C2PA manifests could be used to prevent the Liar’s Dividend, or the dismissal of real footage by suggesting that it is a deepfake or in other ways manipulated in order to avoid accountability. On the other hand, the mere existence of a provenance and authenticity ecosystem, bolstered by the C2PA specifications, could result in higher expectations of forensic proof of visual or audiovisual evidence of human rights violations. If this is the case, questions about accessibility and privacy arise, as well as about the requirements to determine authenticity in legal and social scenarios. To put it differently: Who will take the stand? If jurors and judges come to expect higher levels of admissibility of multimedia content, then witnesses could be asked to verify, corroborate, or authenticate multimedia evidence more frequently. Who will determine what is authentic in this case? There are also questions around the legal use of C2PA manifests. Although the C2PA has not been designed to be used in legal procedures, it may still become an element of consideration in certain scenarios, both to add a layer of trust or to dismiss otherwise authentic content.","title":"C2PA Harms Modelling","component":"specifications","version":"1.0","name":"Harms_Modelling","url":"/specifications/1.0/security/Harms_Modelling.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This document provides information security considerations for technology described in the C2PA core specification. It complements security-related content in other C2PA documents. This document includes: A summary of relevant security features of C2PA technology Security considerations for practical use of C2PA technology Threats to C2PA technology and respective treatment of those threats, including countermeasures Analysis in this document does not assess security risk or likelihoods associated with threats or outcomes. These may vary based on a number of factors, such as the context in which C2PA technology is deployed and changes in the threat landscape. However, content in this document may be helpful in developing security risk and likelihood assessments related to use of C2PA technology. Content in this document is non-normative and does not specify requirements for complying with the C2PA specification. While the C2PA endeavours to develop and maintain a comprehensive threat model and security considerations for C2PA technology, we expect this work to be ongoing as technology develops and the threat landscape evolves. This document is a work in progress. The C2PA builds security into our designs as they are being developed, but also expects that security design and threat modelling will continue as the system, ecosystem, and threat landscape evolve. To this end, the C2PA uses a focused threat modelling process to support development of a strong security and privacy design. Outcomes of the effort directly support development of documentation about explicit threats and security considerations while also facilitating security-oriented thinking throughout the design process. The threat modelling process combines synchronous (i.e., live) threat modelling sessions with focused groups of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the asynchronous development of content. The number of attendees in each synchronous session is kept small to promote efficient discussions, but all members of the C2PA have the opportunity to participate via either modality. Like other security activities, we expect our threat modelling process to evolve with the C2PA ecosystem. Process documentation is considered a guide rather than a strict directive on how threat modelling works within the C2PA. In this document asset refers to C2PA assets and not conventional threat model assets. A variety of references and experiences are used to inform threat modelling and related security activities for the C2PA. This section provides a subset of public documents for reference. IETF on security considerations IETF on privacy considerations (guidelines) W3C security and privacy self-review questionnaire OAuth2 threat model (example) Threat Modelling: Designing for Security OWASP Threat Modelling Microsoft Threat Modelling This section summarizes C2PA features that support the security model specified later in this document. The C2PA core specification should be considered the canonical reference for C2PA features. It supersedes summaries provided here. C2PA enables consumers to reason about asset provenance. C2PA specifies a model for asset provenance based on the following definitions. Provenance The logical concept of understanding the history of an asset and its interaction with actors and other assets, as represented by the provenance data. Provenance data The set of C2PA Manifest_s for an _asset and, in the case of a composed asset, its ingredients. A C2PA Manifest can reference other _C2PA Manifest_s. Assertion A data structure which represents a statement asserted by an actor concerning the asset. This data is a part of the C2PA Manifest. Claim A digitally signed and tamper-evident data structure that references a set of assertions by one or more actors, concerning an asset, and the information necessary to represent the content binding. If any assertions were redacted, then a declaration to that effect is included. This data is a part of the C2PA Manifest. Claim signature The digital signature on the claim using the private key of an actor. The claim signature is a part of the C2PA Manifest. C2PA Manifest The set of information about the provenance of an asset based on the combination of one or more assertions (including content bindings), a single claim, and a claim signature. A C2PA Manifest is part of a C2PA Manifest Store. A C2PA Manifest can reference other _C2PA Manifest_s. Origin The C2PA Manifest in the provenance data which represents the software or device that initially created the asset. Details on how one determines which C2PA Manifest is the origin are left for specification. Active Manifest The last manifest in the list of C2PA Manifests inside of a C2PA Manifest Store which is the one with the set of content bindings that are able to be validated. Figure 1. A C2PA Manifest and its constituent parts The basis of making trust decisions in C2PA, its Trust Model, is the identity of the actor associated with the cryptographic signing key used to sign the claim in the active manifest. The identity of a signatory is not necessarily a human actor, and the identity presented may be a pseudonym, completely anonymous, or pertain to a service or trusted hardware device with its own identity, including an application running inside such a service or trusted hardware. C2PA Manifests can be validated indefinitely regardless of whether the cryptographic credentials used to sign its contents are later expired or revoked. In addition to identity, C2PA leverages trusted time-stamps to ensure the correctness of signing and revocation processes. A benefit of this approach is that revocation status can be optionally obtained when claims are generated (rather than when consumed), and revocation can be applied to subsets of signatures by time-stamp. See the Trust Model section of the specification for more details. C2PA uses a combination of cryptographic hashes and signatures to ensure that any tampering of the asset provenance can be detected. C2PA does not offer any protection against the complete removal of C2PA manifests from assets, but the design does aim to prevent any unauthorized tampering of either the digital asset content or the C2PA manifests themselves. The C2PA Guidance document for implementers offers direction about how soft bindings and manifest repositories could be used to address the removal situation. Details on supported cryptographic hashing and signature schemes, as well as format details, are covered in the specification’s Cryptography section. As noted there, the C2PA maintains lists of supported algorithms and certificate types that aim to adhere to cryptographic and compatibility best practices. Detail on how signing credentials relate to identity are included in the Trust Model section of the specification. The Validation section provides details on validating claims, which includes validating signatures. Content bindings associate provenance data in C2PA Manifests with assets. In the context of a C2PA Manifest, hard bindings provide a strict cryptographic binding between provenance and an asset; they aim to provide some useful guarantees against tampering. Soft bindings provide less strict binding between the provenance and an asset. They may associate C2PA provenance with multiple assets, and vice versa. The soft binding section goes into details about how soft bindings can be used with C2PA Manifests. C2PA Manifest Stores are usually embedded into assets but they may exist externally, such as when served as part of the same or linked HTTP connection. In addition, C2PA Manifest Stores may also be decoupled from assets, enabling the C2PA Manifest to be retrieved and processed separately from the asset. Validation checks provenance claim signatures and performs supporting operations. The validation algorithm is described in detail in the validation section of the C2PA specification. C2PA provides features that can be used to protect confidentiality of personal information while still establishing the provenance of an asset. Anonymous or pseudo-anonymous identities may be used for signing claims. Assertions that may contain sensitive information can be removed via redaction. Assertions can be customized for specific workflows, such as where specific information is required to remain encrypted end-to-end. Manifests may include W3C Verifiable Credentials. Note that confidentiality of personal information and other privacy-related concerns are addressed in the Harms Considerations document. The C2PA security model is focused on security of C2PA provenance data. While attackers may aim to compromise the security of other aspects of the system, this model assumes the pivotal goal is compromise of C2PA provenance. The following principles should hold: Integrity Attempts to compromise the integrity of C2PA provenance data associated with a respective asset will be detected upon validation. This includes all data stored within C2PA Manifests. For embedded C2PA Manifests, malicious association of an existing manifest with a differing asset is also tamper-evident. In addition, the following actions are tamper-evident for all manifests: C2PA Manifest Store: Malicious addition or removal of a manifest. C2PA Manifest: Malicious modification of an active or ingredient manifest. Claims and claim signatures: Addition, removal, or modification of an existing claim in an existing C2PA Manifest. Assertions: Addition, removal, or modification of assertions in the assertion store referenced by an existing claim. Availability An attacker may degrade availability of C2PA data, but C2PA should provide means to mitigate this impact. For example: An attacker may strip manifests from C2PA-enabled assets altogether. Guidance is provided on how to mitigate the impact of this scenario. While C2PA supports cloud-hosted information that is referenced from assertions, the validation algorithm makes retrieval of that information optional for validation in order that any network attacks (e.g, DDOS, tracking, etc.) cannot impact user experience. Confidentiality C2PA does not specify confidentiality properties for assets, provenance model primitives, private address books, or cryptographic secrets. They may be kept confidential via other means. For example by transmitting assets via TLS. However, enforcing this confidentiality is considered out-of-scope for this specification. Some private data, such as claim signing keys or private address books, must adhere to conventional confidentiality principles. Compromise of this private data could lead to indirect violation of other principles specified in this section. Enforcing confidentiality of this adjacent private data is considered out-of-scope for this specification. C2PA does not specify Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology. C2PA does not specify guarantees of confidentiality of personal information. However, C2PA provides features that can be used to protect confidentiality of personal information (summary) Confidentiality of personal information and other privacy-related concerns are addressed in the Harms Considerations document. In general, these assertions are achieved through application of the C2PA Trust Model to the claim generation process, and corresponding checks in the validation process. This section documents information security threats to C2PA technology. Threats are described as threat scenarios and organized categorically by prospective attacker goals; where an attacker goal is what the attacker is trying to achieve, or the desired outcome of the threat scenario. Each threat scenarios is described as follows: Description: A short description of the threat scenario Prerequisites: Relevant requirements for attempting an attack or threat scenario Impact analysis: Summary of the impact of the threat scenario on the C2PA security model Guidance: Any supplementary security guidance on addressing the threat scenario or treating potential residual security risk This document refers to threat sources, agents, actors and other malicious entities commonly as attackers. The following assumptions are made about entities that may attack C2PA technology: Attackers have full access to public assets and associated public metadata, including C2PA Manifests. Attackers may attempt to access claim generator software (e.g., C2PA-enabled photo editing software) as a typical user. Attackers do not have access to private keys referenced within the C2PA ecosystem (e.g., claim signing private keys, Time-stamping Authority private keys, etc.). They may, however, attempt to access these keys via exploitation techniques. Attackers have the ability to publish assets to an impactful audience, for example, as a social media user. Quantum computing cryptanalytic attacks are considered out-of-scope. The following additional assumptions are made about the threat model: Attacks that rely on bypassing conventional security models of non-C2PA technology are considered out-of-scope. For example: Attacks against the C2PA Validator as an architectural component within a user agent (e.g., web browser) are considered in-scope. A compromise of the C2PA validation logic via some non-C2PA attack vector within the user agent is considered out-of-scope, since this would typically require bypassing the security model of the user agent (e.g., escaping a web browser sandbox or compromising the host via other means). Attacks across conventional trust boundaries are considered in-scope. For example, attacks against C2PA-enabled assets traversing the internet. Threat scenarios in this category aim to prevent media consumers from reasoning about the provenance of assets. In terms of the security model, this is a compromise of availability of C2PA provenance data. An attacker removes C2PA Manifests from an asset delivered with hard bindings. For example, by downloading C2PA-enabled media from a social media site, stripping the C2PA Manifest(s), and re-posting it. Technical ability to strip provenance data from published or stored assets and deliver the stripped assets targeted users or systems. For example, via republishing to social media or on-path attacks. It is possible for an attacker to remove metadata as described. Depending on the context, this could cause a user agent not to display provenance information associated with the asset. The impact of this threat scenario could be mitigated through use of manifest repositories, e.g., by making C2PA Manifests available to user agents when embedded manifests are missing. Use of manifest repositories can introduce security and privacy issues. See the Content binding security section for more information. An attacker removes metadata from within C2PA Manifests(s) stored in a asset delivered with hard bindings, such as the assertion store, individual assertions, claims, claim signatures, etc. For example, by downloading C2PA-enabled media from a social media site, stripping the target C2PA metadata, and re-posting it. Technical ability to strip provenance data from published or stored assets and deliver the stripped assets targeted users or systems. For example, via republishing to social media or on-path attacks. It is possible for an attacker to remove metadata as described. However, validation checks as implemented by C2PA validator will detect any complete or partial removal of metadata stored within C2PA Manifests due to the use of cryptographic hashes. Removal of an entire C2PA Manifest is possible, and described as a distinct threat scenario. This is similar to the case of stripping all C2PA metadata. However, in this scenario there is an added benefit that user agents can explicitly detect the attempt to remove metadata as part of the validation process. The impact of this threat scenario is mitigated through explicit detection of missing metadata through the standard C2PA validation process and factoring this into system behaviour. For example, a user agent would display the affected asset differently than a non-modified asset. (For more information about the user experience aspects, see C2PA’s UX Guidance) The impact of this threat scenario could be also mitigated through use of manifest repositories, e.g., by making decoupled C2PA Manifests available to user agents when embedded metadata is missing. Use of manifest repositories can introduce security and privacy issues. See the Content binding security section for more information. Threat scenarios in this category aim to modify or spoof provenance information associated with C2PA-enabled assets, e.g., to present misleading provenance data to media consumers. This is considered a compromise of integrity of provenance data in terms of the C2PA security model. An attacker copies valid, hard-bound C2PA metadata, such as assertions, claims, or entire C2PA Manifests, from one C2PA-enabled asset to another. Technical ability to strip provenance data from published or stored assets and deliver the stripped assets targeted users or systems. For example, via republishing to social media or on-path attacks. An attacker is able to perform the copying as described. However, C2PA hard bindings provide a cryptographic binding between assets and C2PA Manifests via claim signatures. Thus, validation checks (e.g., as implemented by a user agent) will detect the replaced C2PA Manifests. This is similar to the case of stripping all C2PA metadata. However, in this scenario there is an added benefit that user agents can explicitly detect the attempt to remove metadata as part of the validation process. The impact of this threat scenario could be mitigated through explicit detection of incorrect metadata as described here, and factoring this into system behaviour. For example, a user agent would display the affected asset differently than a non-modified asset. (For more information about the user experience aspects, see C2PA’s UX Guidance). The impact of this threat scenario could be also mitigated through use of manifest repositories, e.g., by making decoupled C2PA Manifests available to user agents when embedded metadata is missing. Use of manifest repositories can introduce security and privacy issues. See the Content binding security section for more information. An attacker compromises the confidentiality of a claim signing key and uses it to attach valid, malicious provenance to a asset. Ability to read and use a valid C2PA claim signing key. For example by stealing it from a claim generation and signing system. Ability to copy, modify, or generate assets, add desired (valid) C2PA provenance metadata to them, and deliver them to targeted users or systems. For example, via republishing to social media or on-path attacks. An attacker that is able to steal a signing key can spoof valid C2PA Manifests on arbitrary assets. This applies to both hard and soft bindings. Valid claim signatures will be limited to the exposed key; an attacker cannot impersonate other signers in this scenario. These manifests will pass validation checks. Further, an attacker will be able to continue to generate assets with spoofed provenance until the compromised credential is revoked, and revocation status is propagated to the targeted users/systems. If the signer’s credential type does not support or provide a means for revocation, it may be necessary to remove the trust anchor associated with the signer’s credential from the respective C2PA trust list to effectively revoke the malicious manifests. In this case, all manifests associated with the trust anchor will be invalidated. Revocation of the signing key associated with the malicious manifests may invalidate other manifests if signing keys are reused between claim generation / claim signing system users. Claim generators must adhere to best practices for securing keys in their respective operating environments. This includes using platform-specific best practices for key storage and management (e.g., hardware security modules, key management services), minimizing key reuse, and revoking keys when compromise is suspected. For more information on key management, see the NIST Key Management Guidelines. It is highly recommended that all signing credentials include revocation information. An attacker misuses a legitimate claim generator (e.g., photo editing service) to add misleading provenance to a C2PA-enabled asset. Ability to access and exploit or misuse a claim generator system. For example, misuse of a claim generator may result in malicious additions of C2PA Manifests or Claims to assets; exploitation of vulnerabilities in claim generators may lead to modification or tampering with existing C2PA Manifest data added with the target claim generator’s signing key(s). Ability to deliver assets to targeted users. For example, via publishing to social media or on-path attacks. An attacker may be able to misuse or exploit a claim signing system to create malicious C2PA Manifests. These can then be delivered to targeted users/systems. Note that valid claim signatures will be limited to credentials used by the targeted claim signing system; an attacker cannot impersonate other signers in this scenario. If the signer’s credential type does not support or provide a means for revocation, it may be necessary to remove the trust anchor associated with the signer’s credential from the respective C2PA trust list to effectively revoke the malicious manifests. In this case, all manifests associated with the trust anchor will be invalidated. Revocation of the signing key associated with the malicious manifests may invalidate other manifests if signing keys are reused between claim generation / claim signing system users. Claim generators must adhere to industry best practices for information security and anti-abuse practices, including leveraging available platform-specific features for deployment (e.g. Android SafetyNet, Apple DeviceCheck). Likewise, claim generators should use platform-specific best practices for key storage and management. For example, usage of hardware security modules, key management services), minimizing key reuse, and revoking keys when compromise is suspected. For more information on key management, see the NIST Key Management Guidelines. It is highly recommended that all signing credentials include revocation information. An attacker causes a C2PA claim signing key issuer to issue a valid signing key to them. They then use this signing key to add misleading provenance to a C2PA-enabled media asset. Ability to bypass unspecified processes for obtaining a claim signing key. An attacker that is able to obtain a legitimate claim signing key can spoof valid C2PA Manifests on arbitrary media assets. These manifests will pass validation checks. Further, an attacker will be able to continue to generate media assets with spoofed provenance until the compromised credential is revoked, and revocation status is propagated to the targeted users/systems. It may be necessary to remove the trust anchor associated with the signer’s credential from the respective C2PA trust list to effectively revoke malicious manifests. In this case, all manifests associated with the trust anchor will be invalidated. The C2PA does not currently specify requirements regarding issuance of claim signing keys. It is recommended that these processes be robust against exploitation and misuse. The CAB Forum Baseline Requirements provide a working example of security requirements for signing credential issuers. An attacker finds a media asset with a C2PA Manifest Store that includes an ingredient manifest with a signature from valid, non-public, credentials. They replace the ingredient manifest with a malicious manifest. Ability to discover media with susceptible ingredient manifest and generate a malicious replacement. And deliver the media asset to the target users/systems. Validation of ingredients is optional, however, validation of the hash of the ingredient’s manifest at the time it was added to the active manifest as an ingredient is not. See the Validation section of the C2PA specification for details. While a C2PA validator is not expected to have access to the original, non-public, signing credential nor to the original ingredient asset, it can differentiate between the original and compromised provenance by checking the hashed_uri present in the ingredient assertion. Since the malicious manifest will not match the original, the validator is able to detect the attack. Claim generators should add review ratings to their assertion metadata to propagate their assessment of ingredients to downstream consumers. When this validation is performed on both media assets described in this scenario, downstream consumers will be able to differentiate between them. An attacker generates a malicious media asset whose soft binding matches the soft binding of a legitimate, target media asset. The attacker creates a decoupled, soft-bound manifest for the malicious media asset and injects it into a manifest repository. The malicious media asset is then delivered to the target/system user, which retrieves the legitimate C2PA Manifest via the common soft binding. Ability to generate a colliding soft binding for a target media asset and publish the resulting manifest such that it will be retrieved by the target user/system for the target media asset. Also requires that access to be able to add manifests to a manifest repository. Malicious media bound to legitimate C2PA provenance data is validated and presented to the target system/user. C2PA provides guidance on applying soft bindings, which may include algorithms for mitigating this type of attack. See the content binding documentation for details. An attacker copies a valid W3C Verified Credential (VC) from an existing C2PA Manifest. The attacker then creates a separate, valid C2PA Manifest that includes the copied VC, misleading information, and a valid claim signature. The resulting manifest is presented to consumers. Ability to copy a valid VC from an existing C2PA Manifest Ability to generate and sign a claim that passes validation Ability to deliver assets to consumer(s), for example via publishing to social media Consumers are presented with UX that indicates the subject of copied VC is associated with the manipulated asset. User agents must make a clear separation between the signer of the Claim and any included W3C Verifiable Credentials. It must be clear that the association of those VCs to assertions, are made by the claim signer (i.e., the subject of the VC was not responsible for the association). Claim generators and signing operations should adhere to security best practices. An attacker generates a dummy media asset whose soft binding matches the soft binding of another media asset. They then use a claim generator to create a valid, malicious C2PA claim(s), and a C2PA Manifest. They then publish the C2PA Manifest to a manifest repository. When the target media asset is validated, the malicious C2PA Manifest is retrieved via the common soft binding. Ability to generate a colliding soft binding for a target media asset and publish the resulting manifest such that it will be retrieved by the target user/system for the target media asset. Malicious provenance data bound to a legitimate media asset is validated and presented to the target system/user. C2PA provides guidance on applying soft bindings, which may include algorithms for mitigating this type of attack. See the content binding documentation for details. Threat scenarios in this category do not aim to break the C2PA security model. Rather, they aim to leverage C2PA functionality to perform systems attacks or exploitation. Note that the set of scenarios included here is not meant to be comprehensive; they focus on application of known exploitation techniques against behaviour explicitly referenced in the C2PA specification.","title":"C2PA Security Considerations","component":"specifications","version":"1.0","name":"Security_Considerations","url":"/specifications/1.0/security/Security_Considerations.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Public review, feedback and evolution This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The C2PA intends to provide clear guidance for implementers of provenance-enabled user experiences (UX). Developing these recommendations is an ongoing process that involves diverse stakeholders. The results will balance uniformity and familiarity with utility and flexibility for users across contexts, platforms, and devices. Our intent is to present a comprehensive range of conventions for the user experience and evolve them based on feedback. Please reference the Glossary in the C2PA Specifications for clarifications on terminology used within this document. For general guidance on other areas of the specification, please see Guidance for Implementors. The UX recommendations aim to define best practices for presenting C2PA provenance to consumers. The recommendations strive to describe standard, readily recognizable experiences that: provide asset creators a means to capture information and history about the content they are creating, and provide asset consumers information and history about the content they are experiencing, thereby empowering them to understand where it came from and decide how much to trust it. User interfaces designed for the consumption of C2PA provenance must be informed by the context of the asset. C2PA have studied four primary user groups and a collection of contexts in which C2PA assets are encountered. These user groups have been defined in the C2PA Guiding Principles as Consumers, Creators, Publishers and Verifiers (or Investigators). To serve the needs of each of these groups across common contexts, exemplary user interfaces are presented for many common cases. These are recommendations, not mandates, and we expect best practices to evolve. A unique aspect of this approach is that rather than attempt to determine the veracity of an asset for a user, it enables users themselves to judge by presenting the most salient and/or comprehensive provenance information. As such it is critical that users develop trust in the system itself, over the individual data presented. Exposing the C2PA Trust Model and Trust Signals in a way that balances transparency and intuitiveness is the critical design goal addressed here. There is no design pattern that can guarantee to engender trustworthiness across multiple contexts, and while a degree of contextual customization is anticipated, C2PA recommends all implementations adhere to the following general principles. Implementations should be created using industry standard, robust user interface technologies. Implementations should adhere to accepted, current accessibility standards to ensure no users are excluded. For an example of such criteria, see the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Wherever suitable, UX patterns should match those outlined here. In the case that this would break contextual paradigms of the platform, lean on precedent whether in the OS or app design. Users should not have to learn new paradigms or terminology in different contexts in order to access the information. In many cases, a subset of the available information will be the most useful to a user in a given context. A link to the full information should always be made available, however. Some data will assert an individual or organizational identity. Wherever possible, a link to information about the identity should be made available to allow the user to make a judgement on those actors' trustworthiness. Because the complete set of C2PA data for a given asset can be overwhelming to a user, C2PA describes four levels of progressive disclosure which guide the designs: Figure 1. Disclosure levels Level 1 An indication that C2PA data is present and its cryptographic validation status. Level 2 A summary of C2PA data available for a given asset. Should provide enough information for the particular content, user, and context to allow the consumer to understand to a sufficient degree how the asset came to its current state. Level 3 A detailed display of all relevant provenance data. Note that the relevance of certain items over others is contextual and determined by the UX implementer. Level 4 For sophisticated, forensic investigatory usage, a standalone tool capable of revealing all the granular detail of signatures and trust signals is recommended. In addition to these standard levels, there will be common tools available for those interested in a full forensic view of the provenance data. This would reveal all available C2PA data across all manifests for an asset, including signature details. Figure 2. The L1 indicator Following the consistency principle, it is important in developing trust that users can learn to easily recognize the presence of the system and that their expectations are met regardless of context. As such, the L1 indicator should be consistent in its appearance across all contexts and devices to the degree that it clearly represents the presence of C2PA data. L1 can be applied using only the icon, the title, or both. If using the icon alone, ensure its appearance meets accessibility criteria so that consumers can easily identify its presence on or near the C2PA-enabled content. We recommend using the placeholder “information seal” icon and working title “Content Credentials” for recognition and learned understanding of C2PA-enabled content. We may make updates to the icon and product name in upcoming versions of this document as we gather findings from on-going user research. For flexibility across implementations, there are several recommended placements for L1 indicators when C2PA-enabled content is present: on top of the content or somewhere close enough that its relationship to the content is clear. If L1 is positioned on top of the content, a hover state may be applied so as not to permanently obstruct the content below. Applications may differ depending on device, such as revealing L1 via long-press on mobile. Partially overlapping the L1 indicator over content is the most robust option to avoid potential misuse in the scenario that it has been purposefully added to content in a way meant to deceive. A new user experience guidance is recommended for initial implementation rollout to make clear how to identify L1 indicators. Behaviour of L1 indicators should reveal L2 progressive disclosure, either via a hover or click interaction. Within L2 user interfaces, L1 can continue to be used to indicate the presence of C2PA-enabled ingredients. Figure 3. L1 validation states In the event that the active manifest is incomplete or invalid, a stateful indicator of data validation can be displayed. There are several scenarios when displaying a data validation state may be necessary. See Chapter 14, Validation in the C2PA Technical Specifications for further information. It is important to align any interface language with the recommended terminology and phrases. This lets terminology retain the same meaning and weight across experiences, which is best for user comprehension. It also ensures the value and adoption of content provenance, thus making C2PA data easier to understand and promote across a large ecosystem. For customization of UI elements, use the recommended terms or customize with user comprehension in mind. In the following table, we recommend terminology for consumer-facing L1 UI: Table 1. L1 recommended content terms and descriptions Term/phrase Description Usage notes Content credentials Content provenance and attribution data Use title case when referring to the system name and sentence case when referring to the data itself As a reminder, this is a working title and is subject to change Incomplete Someone has changed this content without updating the content credentials, so there may be unexplained changes. Consider pairing with a visual indicator that suggests users proceed with caution when viewing C2PA data Invalid Someone has changed or tampered with the content credentials, so the available data should be disregarded Consider pairing with a visual indicator that conveys clear negativity and risk so users can understand the C2PA data should not be used to assess the content Figure 4. Minimum viable provenance display If L1 indicates the presence of C2PA data, L2 is where consumers can begin to view and interact with the data. The minimum L2 user experience is defined as the display of nothing more than the base required C2PA manifest data: the signing entity, the claim generator and date. The signer is a top trust signal that allows the consumers to make their judgement trusting that the information available has been 'backed' by a legitimate entity. C2PA anticipates that additional varying assertion data will be included by implementers, and recommends including the manifest thumbnail, signer logo, and a link to L3 where consumers can find more provenance data if available. L2 styles, fonts, etc. can be customized to fit the given context. Iconography and terminology used to describe assertions should be consistent wherever possible. C2PA anticipates the need for L2 generally to be space-efficient as it appears within the implementer’s context. Therefore it is suggested the data displayed be streamlined to provide enough information for the particular content, user, and context, allowing the consumer to understand to a sufficient degree how the asset came to its current state. L2 UI options are displayed along a spectrum from depth of information to breadth of provenance representation. In the figure below, the left side represents a single manifest summary and the right side represents the complete provenance summary depicting multiple manifests. However, the middle example shows a customized provenance summary wherein certain manifest assertions are highlighted. This flexibility allows implementers to show more depth for a given subset of manifests. Figure 5. Provenance summary depth versus breadth In order to summarize the data in a context-specific manner, it is recommended that consideration is given to what balance of depth and breadth of data will be most relevant to users. For example, if a given piece of content has only one manifest, consider displaying more of its assertion data, as in Figure 6. A single manifest summary. If there are multiple manifests, then depicting the entire provenance summary may give users a more complete understanding of the content’s history, such as in Figure 8. Provenance summary, three manifests. However, in all likelihood there will be many cases that fall in between, like in Figure 12. Customized summary combinations. The following sections will further document UI options along this spectrum. Figure 6. A single manifest summary A manifest summary only represents a single manifest. It could be the active manifest, as this is the most recent version tied to the C2PA-enabled content, or an ingredient manifest as determined by the implementer. The determination for displaying an ingredient manifest should be if there is substantive assertion data the implementer believes is more relevant to its audience than that of the active manifest. A shortcoming of displaying a single manifest summary is that it may not represent the complete history of the C2PA-enabled content, and may require consumers to navigate away from the implementer’s context to L3 to learn more. A provenance summary represents the collection of manifests related to the C2PA-enabled content. Manifests should be presented in the order that they are referenced via ingredient assertions, starting with the active manifest at the top and ending with the origin ingredients below. Origin ingredients represent the beginning of their respective history branches. Figure 7. Provenance summary, two manifests Summary displays should show at minimum the origin ingredients and active manifests, or if screen real estate allows, with at least one manifest in between. Figure 8. Provenance summary, three manifests In order to provide users with a succinct summary and to allow for limited screen real estate, the manifests in between origin and active can be collapsed and represented as a numerical count. C2PA recommends a baseline rule for collapsing manifests if the total number exceeds four. However, this threshold can be altered according to context. In keeping with the core recommendations, a link to the full set of data in L3 should always follow the summary list of manifests. Figure 9. Provenance summary, four manifests When multiple origins are present, either as multiple ingredients in a single manifest or across multiple manifests, they can be summarized in the origin section of the UI. The L1 indicator can be used as a badge on ingredient thumbnails to distinguish C2PA-enabled assets. Figure 10. Provenance summary, two origins L2 UI is flexible enough to allow for various combinations of manifest counts and origin assets. Figure 11. Provenance summary, multiple origins and manifests Implementers should consider audience needs when weighing the balance of depth and breadth in combinatory summaries in order to concisely display the most complete and relevant representation of content provenance. For example, travel companies may opt to display location assertions from the origin manifest in a provenance summary so as to provide their users with key information. Similarly, a news publisher may choose to show action assertions from an ingredient manifest to disclose edits that occurred to published content. Figure 12. Customized summary combinations There will be instances when C2PA-enabled content is incomplete data. Most commonly, this will happen if the content is edited without capturing C2PA data. In this event, the L1, L2 and L3 UI should reflect when data is incomplete, as well as the manifest data that came before or after. A dotted line can be drawn between manifests to suggest the connection is not the same as between valid, intact manifests. Incomplete data should not automatically signal that one should discount the content as untrustworthy. For this reason, C2PA discourages the use of an indicator designed to trigger alarm, which should be reserved for more apparent tamper-evident use cases, in favour of a more descriptive and neutral indicator. Figure 13. Incomplete data in the active manifest position Figure 14. Incomplete data in an ingredient position Following the established pattern of collapsing additional manifests, incomplete data can be called out via the text string to bring awareness to the questionable validity of ingredients. Figure 15. Incomplete data collapsed There may be instances when C2PA-enabled content has been maliciously edited to tamper with C2PA data, or is signed by an untrusted entity. In this case, no additional prior data can be displayed. Figure 16. Invalid data in the active manifest position Figure 17. Invalid data in an ingredient position Please refer to L1 interface language for a reminder of the importance of adhering to recommended terms and descriptions. The following table contains terminology for UI elements such as commonly used categories and validation states: Table 2. L2 recommended content terms and descriptions Term/phrase Description Usage notes Content credentials Content provenance and attribution data Consider using as a UI header to contextualize C2PA data displays As a reminder, this is a working title and is under discussion Signed by / Signer The signer is responsible for the trustworthiness of the content and its C2PA data Must be displayed Date and timestamp The time and time zone at which the signer signed the manifest Recommended inclusion to accompany signer Appearance of formatting should be localized to consumer’s region Edits and activity Actions taken on the asset Upcoming UX recommendations will attempt to standardize categorizations of actions for user comprehension Assets used / Assets Ingredients used in a given manifest Recommended display for discrete manifest summaries Produced by / Producer The name and role of the person identified by the active manifest as its producer Consider a customization or UI pattern to clarify how identity is being validated (see more in creator identity) This term is intended to represent a diverse range of roles, but can be customized based on the CreativeWork assertion Content credentials are incomplete Someone has changed this content without updating the content credentials, so there may be unexplained changes Should follow L1 validation state Content credentials are invalid Someone has changed or tampered with the content credentials, so the available data should be disregarded Should follow L1 validation state Additional manifests There are # additional manifests in this provenance line Use to represent manifest count when there are four or more manifests in the provenance summary Additional manifests and incomplete content credentials There are # additional manifests in this provenance line, and some have incomplete data Use to represent manifest count when there are four or more manifests in the provenance summary and one or more are incomplete Since video is a temporal medium, it poses significant challenges to distilling provenance data into simple, consumer-friendly displays. This is due to the potential for high volumes of composited ingredients of varying media formats, applied complex edit actions, spanning multiple software and people. These UX recommendations are focused on a starting point for video provenance and will address more complex uses over time. A notable difference with video content is the necessity for a player for viewing. This limits the ways in which an L1 indicator of C2PA data can be placed on the content and interacted with, and may likely require an integration into the player itself. However, the L1 indicator may still be placed next to the video outside of the content. Figure 18. Video L1 Video L2 displays should largely follow the same patterns as described in L2 – progressive disclosures. However, for now we stop short of recommending the inclusion of ingredients or non-C2PA origin content due to the potential complexity of volume. Instead, we suggest showing a minimal manifest summary or provenance summary. Figure 19. Video L2 minimum viable provenance Figure 20. Video L2 provenance summary An important detail for video UX is the L2 thumbnail displays. Video thumbnails should be represented as either the poster attribute as defined by the creation platform, or the first frame of the video generated at manifest creation. To help distinguish video assets from images, a filmstrip icon is added to the thumbnail to depict its media type. We anticipate supporting time-coded assertions in future versions of the spec, but in the near term, we recommend following L2 conventions as described above. In this section, the term creator means a party creating manifests. This could be the maker of an original work, an editor, or anyone else utilizing C2PA-enabled tools to add to the provenance chain. As per the C2PA Guiding Principles, C2PA implementations should provide a mechanism for creators of a given content to assert, in a verifiable manner, any information they wish to disclose about the creation of that content and any actions taken since the asset’s creation. As such, the creator experience requires the following: A clear acknowledgement of creator consent before a C2PA implementation can begin accumulating data; Disclosure or preview of the nature of information that is being recorded; Creator control over recorded information, with particular sensitivity to the creator’s identity and process. C2PA recommends an opt-in flow that concisely represents these requirements and can be opted-out of just as easily at any time. Once opted-in, creators should be able to distinguish between non-removable information as defined by the C2PA specifications and information that can be adjusted according to the user’s preferences. Creators should be able to control the information in their assertions as much as is allowed by C2PA specifications. The Harms Modelling document covers the reasoning behind why creator control is imperative. To provide coverage against harms and misuse, C2PA suggests the following types of assertions be manageable by the creator: Identity information Actions Creative Work Fields pertaining to copyright, descriptions, and usage rights Exif information and related metadata To be accommodating to the user’s preferences, C2PA recommends presenting a UI wherein these assertion categories can be toggled on or off on a per document basis. To assist the creator in understanding the tradeoffs they are making, C2PA also suggests displaying a manifest preview that concisely and accurately depicts what information will be added into the manifest. The identity of the creator, or lack thereof, is an important assertion for the completion of a content’s provenance as it helps consumers understand who is responsible for what happened. It is important to restate that C2PA specifications do not require the identities of persons or organizations making any assertion about an asset to be documented. However, the challenge of validating identity when provided is beyond the scope of the C2PA specification at present. As such, C2PA recommends several tactics to help consumers understand the role of identity in C2PA provenance. The first is to make clear when the creator’s identity is self-assigned. The second is to offer creators the ability to add social media or other verifiable accounts. These identity flows may lie outside of C2PA creator implementations, but when included, have the added benefit of providing a degree of proof for creators as well as links to their presence elsewhere on the internet. When the creator decides to opt out of including their identity information, C2PA recommends promptly updating the manifest preview to reflect this change to give the creator immediate assurance their privacy is being protected. Similar to the treatment of identity, some creators may want to reserve the right to not disclose the actions they’ve taken on a given piece of content. While some use cases, like photojournalism, should always show transparently what actions took place, this is less important for more creative and artistic applications. In some cases, creators may want to protect their particular creation process and should therefore be allowed to opt out of including actions in their manifests. Granularity of actions is worth considering in creator implementations. In some cases, grouping actions into high level categories may be more understandable for consumers, versus presenting a list of detailed, creation-specific actions that may be unique to the implementation. C2PA recommends striking a balance between clarity and information overload based on the intended audience of the implementing platform. Ingredient assertions represent a form of non-removable information because they are the key to the establishment of the provenance of an asset and may themselves contain provenance. As such, ingredients are a requirement to be displayed in the manifest and its creator-side preview. Validation of an ingredient’s manifest is equally important to convey to creators prior to producing a new manifest. Within the manifest preview UI, C2PA recommends displaying a list of ingredient thumbnails and their validation states to ensure the user working with those ingredients is aware of additional provenance data. This is particularly important for cases when ingredients are unable to validate or contain an invalid manifest. A clear example might be a news editor who receives a piece of user-generated content that purports to depict a controversial scene - alerting the editor to the validation state of that image will give them stronger assurances of whether that content is trustworthy. The C2PA Implementation Guidance recommends that a manifest be created for an asset when a significant event in the lifecycle of the asset takes place, such as its initial creation or an \"export\" operation from an editing tool. This is in part due to the underlying technical process of digitally signing the manifest, but also aligns with natural creation workflows. When a creator is ready to export their work, they should be able to decide whether or not to attach the accumulated assertion data to their content. Not every piece of exported content is in need of provenance data, so C2PA recommends enabling the option of attachment on a per document basis. It will also help serve as a reminder to creators that they have opted into the C2PA implementation, which will allow them to protect their privacy as needed. To ensure user comprehension, it is crucial that implementers consider how their audiences are introduced to C2PA provenance data and the value to be gained from engaging with it. We recommend providing creator and consumer educational experiences and strongly encourage the use of language consistent to what is provided in these guidelines. Keeping communication and education aligned is a key part of promoting comprehension, value, and adoption of C2PA data by implementers, creators, and consumers. Depending on the implementer’s platform and audience, there are different ways to effectively incorporate education around C2PA data. We suggest utilizing standard UI elements like links, tooltips, and modals to provide users with opportunities to seek out more information regarding the implementation or a component piece within. Certain L2 UI elements, like assertion categories, may warrant additional explanations to ensure user comprehension. For larger and more detailed explanations, implementers should consider linking out to FAQs or dedicated information pages so audiences can learn more about C2PA from a native product voice. However, when making content customizations, make sure things like brand voice are not prioritized in sacrifice of clarity and user comprehension. Correctly identifying and displaying trust signals is of paramount concern for our overall user experience. C2PA strives to understand the value consumers will apply to content attribution through ongoing user research studies and usability testing. Pending user research, C2PA will provide implementors with recommended L2 customizations based on combinations of content, audiences, and platforms. Examples may include news publishers, social sites, e-commerce and retail, travel, and entertainment platforms. The recommendations for video UX will also continue to expand in scope and complexity, along with the introduction of other media formats like audio and streaming content. While this document primarily covers L1 and L2 consumer experiences, we aim to provide recommendations for the design of L3 interfaces, wherein users can explore a more detailed display of provenance data. The team authoring the UX recommendations is cognizant of its limitations and potential biases, recognizing that feedback, review, user testing and ongoing evolution is a requirement for success. This guidance is therefore an evolving document, informed by real world experiences deploying C2PA UX across a wide variety of applications and scenarios.","title":"C2PA User Experience Guidance for Implementers","component":"specifications","version":"1.0","name":"UX_Recommendations","url":"/specifications/1.0/ux/UX_Recommendations.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This Explainer accompanies Version 1.0 of the Technical Specifications. This Explainer accompanies the C2PA Specifications with the intent of providing further background and clarification on the development of the standard, its goals, mechanisms and guidelines. This Explainer is not a technical document and is directed towards the general public. The goal of the C2PA specifications is to tackle the extraordinary challenge of trusting media in a context of rapidly evolving technology and the democratization of powerful creation and editing techniques. To this end, the specifications are designed to enable global, opt-in, adoption of digital provenance techniques through the creation of a rich ecosystem of digital provenance enabled applications for a wide range of individuals and organizations while meeting appropriate security and privacy requirements, as well as human rights considerations. It is important to highlight that C2PA specifications do not provide value judgments about whether a given set of provenance data is 'true', but instead merely whether the provenance information can be verified as associated with the underlying asset, correctly formed, and free from tampering. Provenance generally refers to the facts about the history of a piece of digital content assets (image, video, audio recording, document). C2PA enables the authors of provenance data to securely bind statements of provenance data to instances of content using their unique credentials. These provenance statements are called assertions by the C2PA. They may include assertions about who created the content and how, when, and where it was created. They may also include assertions about when and how it was edited throughout its life. The content author, and publisher (if authoring provenance data) always has control over whether to include provenance data as well as what assertions are included, such as whether to include identifying information (in order to allow for anonymous or pseudonymous assets). Included assertions can be removed in later edits without invalidating or removing all of the included provenance data in a process called redaction. In the C2PA Specifications, trust decisions are made by the consumer of the asset based on the identity of the actor(s) who signed the provenance data along with the information in the assertions contained in the provenance. This signing takes place at each significant moment in an asset’s life (e.g., creation, editing, etc.) through the use of the actor’s unique credentials and ensures that the provenance data remains cryptographically bound to the newly created or updated asset. To enable consumers to make informed decisions about the provenance of an asset, and prevent unknown attackers from impersonating others, it is critical that each application and ecosystem reliably identify the actor to whom a signing credential is issued. This is accomplished through the use of a certification authority (CA). CAs perform real-world due diligence to ensure credentials are only issued to actors who are whom they claim to be. In the world wide web, CAs verify that someone requesting a certificate to operate a secure web site owns and/or controls the site’s domain name before issuing such a credential. For example, before issuing a certificate for https://c2pa.org/, the CA verified the requestor did in fact control C2PA’s domain name before issuing a certificate for that site name. Unlike the world wide web, C2PA will be used in multiple different application settings, and each setting will have its own requirements. Each application will therefore provide users with one or more trust lists, which are lists of certification authorities that issue credentials for that application. For example, in a news and media aggregation application or web site, each newspaper, television network, or other media organization has a globally-recognized identity, and there is only one such organization that operates with that name. In this situation, because brand marks and other visual indicators can and have been reproduced for the purposes of impersonation, consumers want to be certain the media they are consuming actually comes from the source it claims to be. This application would provide at least one trust list maintained by a professional or non-profit organization for journalists and media, which endorses certification authorities that ensure such credentials are only issued to the genuine organization through real-world due diligence. In another example, an insurance company may employ provenance tracking for images, videos, and other media as part of underwriting policies and servicing loss claims to be used by its own employees. In this case, only one trust list is applicable: the insurance company’s own certification authority operated by its Human Resources department, which may already exist to employee credentials for other purposes. Here, it is not important that every participant have a unique name, as several employees may share the same name, but it is important to be assured all participants are employees of the insurance company, which the Human Resources department is certainly able to confirm and attest. Once the credential is issued by a certification authority, the identity it has confirmed and placed in the credential cannot be altered by anyone else, including and especially the credential’s owner. This allows the consumer or user to rely upon the identity presented in a signed asset. The provenance data and the asset are the two parts of the same puzzle - a unique puzzle. The possibility of any other pieces ever matching, either by coincidence or by purposeful creation, is so low that it would be practically impossible. This is known as a hard binding. In other words, any alteration to either the asset or the provenance, however insignificant, would alter the mathematical algorithm - the shape of the piece of the puzzle – in such a way that they would no longer match. For more technical information on this see \"Hard binding\" in the glossary and the non-normative guidance. When one asset is created from a series of other assets, those sources are referred to as the ingredients. Each ingredient that is used in the final (composed) asset can be identified as part of the final provenance, including the addition of the provenance of each individual ingredient. Redaction is the process of permanently removing information - in the world of C2PA it specifically refers to removing assertions. For example, if a human rights organization wishes to remove from an image assertions about the photographer, it can do so via the redaction process. In addition, they could, at the same time, add more information about the time and location of where the image was taken. The act of redaction (and possibly adding addition information) becomes part of the provenance of the asset. Some of the additional areas that information will be provide about include: - Synthetic content - Privacy - Guarantees C2PA is providing the consumer - Who can be / Process of becoming a signer (signing entities) - Discussion of how provenance does not have to include everything from the origin to current due to the Trust Model. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential and general use-cases of the C2PA Specifications. Some of these are taken from, or built upon, the use-cases developed within the Project Origin Alliance and the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) frameworks. Each use-case wil l be described using some generic personas to help make the flow clear. For technical use-case examples, see [Non-normative guidelines]. Alice sends a video to a friend, Bob. The video includes text with alarming and controversial allegations. Bob immediately seeks confirmation of its validity, starting with its provenance. The video that Alice sent contains C2PA provenance. With a C2PA-enabled application, Bob is able to establish that this video has been validated as being published by an organisation he can trust and is held in public high regard. A photojournalist uses a C2PA-enabled capture device during a newsworthy event they are covering. The assets are then brought into a C2PA-enabled editing application, and after editing it, they are sent to a photo editor. The editor makes additional edits also using a C2PA-enabled application. The finalized asset is moved into the content management system of a news organization, which is also C2PA-enabled, before posting the asset to social media. A news publisher is concerned about standards of public comprehension and brand value of its publications which it makes available online through a number of social media platforms. To improve audience confidence about their content, it wishes to provide a means for the audience to verify the content that originated through its output. For content that is consumed without any C2PA provenance, the publisher hopes that the consumer will take extra steps to verify the provenance and authenticity of the asset, instead of immediately attributing it to the site on which it is published. A news video is posted to a social media platform. By utilizing the C2PA-enabled provenance in the video, the social media platform is able to verify that it came from the same source that posted it. An individual in a news/other context using open-source intelligence techniques (OSINT) can use the presence of C2PA provenance in assets to better confirm the history and integrity of media. Additionally, an individual may use a [decoupled binding database] to re-correlate relevant media to its C2PA provenance. A human rights defender manages to capture footage containing C2PA-enabled provenance of police violence during a protest. The human rights defender sends the footage to a human rights organization that verifies that the asset meets video-as-evidence criteria. The human rights organization redacts information about the defender using a C2PA-enabled editing application in order to protect their identity. The C2PA-verified asset is then used to improve the chances of that footage being admissible in court proceedings. To prevent dangerous stereotypes of ideal bodies, a government enacts a law that requires advertisers and social media influencers to specify that their image has been edited if any aspect of a body’s size, shape or skin has been altered. By having their C2PA-enabled editing application add information about each action performed, they can easily comply and the government can easily confirm. Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work. They will be listed here with links to evidence as appropriate. Any additional documents, articles, books, etc. that would be useful to read to get a better understanding of the work of the C2PA will go here.","title":"C2PA Explainer","component":"specifications","version":"1.0","name":"Explainer","url":"/specifications/1.0/explainer/Explainer.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has developed their technical specification for providing content provenance and authenticity. It is designed to enable global, opt-in, adoption of digital provenance techniques through the creation of a rich ecosystem of digital provenance enabled applications for a wide range of individuals and organizations while meeting appropriate security requirements. The specification has been, and continues to be, informed by scenarios, workflows and requirements gathered from industry experts and partner organizations. However many of these requirements are not normative in nature or may differ between organizations or workflows - in those cases it is important to provide non-normative guidance to implementers - which is the goal of this document. This guidance document describes non-normative technical aspects of the C2PA architecture including construction and consumption of the C2PA manifest and its components and the digital signature technology for enabling tamper-evidence as well as establishing trust. It will also address areas where implementers can extend the C2PA architecture and its ecosystem. The C2PA also created their Guiding Principles that address areas such as respecting privacy and personal control of data with a critical eye toward potential abuse and misuse. This guidance document also will help implementers to understand how these concerns should be addressed in their implementations. One area of guidance that is not covered in this document is that of User Experience, as that is covered in a [separate document]. Rather than reading this document from beginning to end, it is recommended that as an implementer is first designing each aspect of their solution, they should review the relevant section of this document to ensure that they take advantage of the guidance provided. Each of the actors in the system that creates or processes an asset will produce one or more assertions about when, where, and how the asset was originated or transformed. An assertion is labelled data which represents a statement made by an actor about an asset. The assertion’s label is defined either by the C2PA specification or an external entity. The set of assertions, their associated labels, and its serialization (i.e., CBOR or JSON-LD) are defined in the C2PA specification. In order to change any of these, such as the data/schema or its serialization, it is necessary to use a new label so that the new information can be clearly identified as different from the original. A use case for creating variants of existing assertions would be to encrypt them to prevent access to those not possessing the necessary decryption key. This might be for privacy protection or the establishment of a more secure end-to-end workflow. For example, if an implementation from Litware.com wished to encrypt the std.exif assertion to hide the information about the capture device, they could create the new assertion label as com.litware.exif or perhaps even com.litware.encrypted-1 if they wanted to even hide what was encrypted. Items for future guidance Guidance is required around which assertions should be chosen and when by different types of implementations. Items for future guidance A C2PA claim generator adds a new manifest to the existing asset’s manifest store to reflect whatever changes it has made. If anything needs to be removed, then the specific assertions are redacted and the redaction reflected in the new manifest. The C2PA recommends that a manifest be created for an asset when a significant event in the lifecycle of the asset takes place, such as its initial creation or an \"Export\" operation from an editing tool. As the creation of a manifest is not a lightweight operation, due to the need to digitally sign the claim as well as potentially retrieve credentials from online services, it is recommended to do it as infrequently as possible. Additionally, the fewer the manifests, the easier validation will be. Normally, an asset’s digital content will be modified between \"significant events\". As such, a standard manifest which includes hard bindings between that digital content and the manifest are provided. However, there are times in an asset’s life where a change is required to the C2PA manifest but the digital content is not impacted. For example, the addition of some new assertion or even the redaction of an existing assertion. In those cases, an update manifest is used. The C2PA architecture supports manifest stores external to the asset they are associated with, in the form of a manifest repository. This is useful when working with a file format that does not support embedding (i.e., text or XML) or when storing the manifest store separately improves workflows (e.g., searching on manifest data in a CMS). When using a cloud service to manage the manifest repository, and serving the manifest stores via http Link headers (as described in the C2PA specification), having the manifest store available at the same origin as the asset is recommended as it would reduce requirements on Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). However, it is worth noting that doing so does not provide any additional privacy or security protection of either the manifest store or the asset. To mitigate risks to user privacy, we recommend manifest repository service providers to allow content creators to retain the ability to redact or remove content from the repository, or to determine which manifest may be publicly queried. For example, a content creator may want to include an information-rich manifest for internal cataloguing purposes, and an updated manifest with redacted information for public distribution. Completely removing an embedded manifest store from an asset is not recommended, unless the manifest store is being \"externalized\" - meaning that an embedded manifest store is replaced by a URI to an external location. This would be useful in scenarios where the size of assets is important but continues to support access to the asset’s provenance. Implementation of the C2PA specification is to be evaluated in the context of the current industry practices around stripping of metadata. Such action is encouraged by both MPEG and JPEG WGs. In addition many publishers including the NYT are stripping image metadata https://blog.imatag.com/state-of-image-metadata-in-news-sites-2019-update. Replacing an existing manifest store with a different manifest store is not recommended since doing so would completely change the provenance of an asset. However, there are some use cases where it could be appropriate. For example, a publisher may wish to remove all details about the capture and edit of an image and leave only their own publishing information. It may not always be possible (or practical) to embed a C2PA Manifest Store in an asset such as in the case of adding provenance information to assets that were created prior to the existence of C2PA. By creating an associated manifest repository for the asset and exposing its location via the methods described here, all assets can have provenance, no matter their age. Ingredients are the key to the establishment of the provenance of an asset, by serving as a listing of what other assets went into the creation of the current asset. Each ingredient that is used can itself contain its provenance, thus creating a rich provenance for the current asset and all of its ingredients. Each ingredient can either be documented as the parentOf the current asset or a componentOf that asset. The value of parentOf is used in the common case where one asset is opened in an editing application, modified, and then saved or exported as another asset. That original version is the parentOf the final (now current) asset. Alternatively, when one asset is created from a series of other assets (such as audio and video clips), those sources are identified as componentOf ingredients. Items for future guidance The C2PA specification supports the inclusion of W3C Verifiable Credentials(VC) into a C2PA Manifest to represent a human or organisation that may be directly associated with an asset in some way, such as the author or publisher. VCs on their own do not infer an association; this is done via credentials links in the various places they are used, such as the stds.schema-org.CreativeWork assertion, or in Assertion Metadata. The actual VC’s are stored as part of the \"VC Store\". The core \"identity\" information is present in the VC’s credentialSubject property, which is required but the VC may also contain any other property that the issuer of the VC wishes to include. All of these properties are then signed and the signing information included as the proof of the VC. However, as mentioned, in the VC data model specification (4.7), \"there are multiple viable proof mechanisms, and this specification does not standardize nor recommend any single proof mechanism for use with verifiable credentials.\" Since there is no standardized approach to validation of proofs, the C2PA specification does not require that VC’s be validated as part of the C2PA Manifest validation process. Every C2PA Manifest is required to have a hard binding to its associated digital asset. Use of hard bindings prevents collision-based attacks associated with soft bindings described below. Selection of the specific hashing algorithm to use for a hard binding should be made based on the requirements of the workflow. In the absence of some compelling reason to do otherwise, it is recommended to use SHA-256. The simplest type of hard binding that can be used to detect tampering is a cryptographic hashing algorithm over some or all of the bytes of an asset as described in the core specification. Traditionally, this type of binding is done over an inclusive list of byte ranges of the asset. However, a number of attacks on an inclusion list-based approach were identified and it was determined that they are prevented by the use of exclusions lists. These vulnerabilities would have allowed content to be added to an asset that altered the digital content without altering the hard bindings. ISO BMFF-based assets utilize a well defined box structure. Accordingly, the provenance content binding for these assets needs to be expressed in terms of that box structure. There are two approaches which were considered for integrating provenance into the ISO BMFF boxes - either by defining which boxes and/or box components should be included in the hash, or conversely, which should be excluded. A number of attacks on an inclusion list-based approach were identified and it was determined that they are prevented by the use of exclusions lists. These vulnerabilities would have allowed content to be added to an ISO BMFF asset that altered the audio/video presentation without altering the hard binding. This is why C2PA ISO BMFF hard bindings are integrated with the box structure using Exclusion Lists. Typically ISO BMFF content need only include the mandatory exclusions required by the C2PA specification. These should be sufficient for the most common brands registered with the MP4 Registry Authority. However, careful consideration should be given to determine if addition boxes should be included for your ISO BMFF brand of asset. Do not add a box to the exclusion list if: the modification of the box can alter the audio-video presentation in any way. the box declares content external to the asset which you wish to be tamper evident. Asset metadata (including any manifest present) may be routinely removed or corrupted by legacy or non-C2PA capable platforms during distribution. This is common, for example, on social media platforms that display asset renditions (e.g. altering the resolution, form factor or quality of the digital content) that do not have the appropriate C2PA Manifests declaring those modifications. Whilst these renditions may not create user perceptible change, they nevertheless change the underlying binary representation of the digital content. Soft bindings provide a means for identifying manifests that have become 'decoupled' from their associated assets in these circumstances. Examples of soft bindings are content fingerprints (such as perceptual hashes) computed from the digital content, or watermarks embedded within the digital content. Consider a data store or repository into which manifests may be stored. A content creator may, at the time of publishing an asset, opt in to the additional storage of that asset’s manifest into the manifest repository. For this workflow, the manifest contains at least one soft binding - for example, a perceptual hash of the digital content. Soft bindings may be used to identify manifests that have become decoupled from their associated assets. When a consumer encounters an asset with no manifest, but would like information on the asset’s provenance, they may compute a soft binding and use it to query the manifest repository. The manifest repository would return any manifests that match that soft binding, for subsequent validation. An alternative application of soft bindings is to mitigate the threat whereby an attacker substitutes the manifest within an asset with another valid manifest in an attempt to explain that asset with false provenance. In circumstances where a consumer wishes for further information on the asset’s provenance, a similar query may be made using the soft binding to return alternative manifests within the repository for the consumer’s consideration. Information within the returned manifests (such as timestamps or digital signatures) may inform subsequent trust decisions made by the consumer on that asset. Recovery from stripping of metadata Alice is a photojournalist, and captures a photo of an important event, editing it to enhance visibility of some of the content. Alice’s camera device is C2PA capable, as is her image editing tool, and so a C2PA Manifest is added to document the capture and editing of her photo. The C2PA Manifest, added by the editing tool, is signed by Alice’s personal key. Bob works for Acme Corp, a news publisher, who wishes to license Alice’s photo for their publication. Bob decides to trust the content from Alice due to the presence of a C2PA Manifest documenting its provenance. Bob incorporates the photo into a composed image for his publication, using a C2PA capable editing tool. The C2PA Manifest is signed by Acme Corp. A soft binding assertion is computed by Acme Corp and added to the manifest prior to signing. A copy of the manifest is stored within a manifest repository maintained by a consortium of news providers. Bob publishes the photo and it is soon redistributed around social media. Charlie is a news consumer and member of the general public. Charlie views a rendition of the photo on social media. The social media platform is not C2PA capable and no C2PA Manifest is contained within the rendition. Furthermore, the rendition of the photo has different resolution / form factor and changed by the social media platform. Charlie wants to know about the provenance of the photo, since it documents an important event. Charlie right-clicks and submits the photo via a browser plug-in to a look-up service operated by a federation of news organisations, of which Acme Corp is a member. Charlie’s browser software computes the soft binding of the photo and send it to that service. Charlie is directed to a web page generated by the service showing matching assets. Charlie visually verifies that the retrieved asset matches the photo he is interested in, and views the manifest. Charlie uses the information in the manifest to help make an informed trust decision based on the provenance of the photo. Recovery from adversarial substitution of manifest Alice is a citizen journalist, and captures a video of major civil unrest using a C2PA capable device, and edits it using C2PA capable editing software. After signing the manifest in her video, a copy of the manifest is stored within a manifest repository maintained by a consortium of news providers. The manifest contains both a hard and a soft binding. Several years pass. Mallory wishes to use Alice’s video to substantiate his story about a recent civil unrest. Mallory strips the C2PA Manifest from Alice’s video and substitutes his own manifest. The manifest is signed and the video asset is distributed online. Bob is a news producer who receives Mallory’s video. Bob suspects the video is fake news. Bob computes a soft binding of the video and submits it to a provenance service of which his organization is a member. The service retrieves the manifest associated with Alice’s video. Bob visually verifies the retrieved manifest matches the video (it includes a thumbnail) and validates the manifest. Bob notices that Alice’s manifest contains signed assertions with a timestamp earlier than those of Mallory’s video. Bob uses knowledge of this previous existing manifest to help make a more informed trust decision on whether to trust the provenance of Mallory’s video. Bob concludes not to trust Mallory’s video, since an earlier manifest explains the video with an alternative provenance trail. Preserving provenance through non-C2PA capable toolchains Acme Corp maintains a content production pipeline where some stages are non-C2PA capable. Bob receives a photograph from freelance photographer Alice, containing a valid C2PA Manifest. Bob’s software inserts into the digital content of the image a watermark containing a unique identifier, and records the unique identifier as a soft binding assertion in the manifest. The manifest is placed within a manifest repository maintained internally by Acme Corp. The content passes through legacy content production processes that strip the C2PA Manifest. The final stages of production are C2PA compliant. The watermark is read from the image and submitted as a query to the manifest repository run internally by Acme Corp. After passing through the non-C2PA tools, the manifest is automatically matched using the embedded watermark, and is included as an ingredient in a new manifest, which documents that actions have been performed on the content prior to entering the C2PA capable final stage of the pipeline. The manifest is embedded into the asset in the usual way. The content is published and provenance of the image may be traced back to Alice by end consumers of the content. Soft bindings are not guaranteed to be exact, and so care should be taken in their use. Consider perceptual hashing; a common form of soft binding algorithm. By design, multiple renditions of the same digital content may generate the same soft binding. However different digital content, or renditions thereof, may generate the same soft binding either in error or due to attacks on the hashing function (for example, adversarial attacks on machine learning models). Therefore we make the following design recommendation on the implementation of soft bindings in C2PA. Soft bindings must not be substituted for hard bindings in order to bind claims within a manifest. The matches made using a soft binding must be interactively verified via human-in-the-loop checking. For example, a thumbnail of an image stored within the manifest might be displayed to aid visual verification of the match made using a soft binding. Hard bindings (cryptographic hashes) may be used as an alternative to soft bindings, to query manifests within a manifest repository. However this method will fail if the digital content has been modified (for example, is an asset rendition). We recommend that services provided for the lookup of manifests using hard or soft bindings advertise the types of binding that may be used as query, using the unique identifier of that binding (per the hard or soft binding registry). We recommend that claim generators that add soft binding assertions to an asset’s manifest do so as an opt-in addition and not make it mandatory. To mitigate risks to user privacy, we recommend that the consumer should be informed explicitly (for example, via opt in) to the querying of the manifest repository. For example, a consumer may interactively initiate a query for an asset containing no manifest in order to recover provenance information about that asset. We also recommend that content creators be informed of the trade offs involved in using manifest repositories that allow for asset link-up with soft bindings; that is, on the one hand, identifying manifests that have become 'decoupled' from their associated assets, while on the other hand, privacy risks that may result from a soft binding link-up to an earlier manifest with, for example, redacted information. To mitigate risks to user privacy and to preserve bandwidth, we recommend that the soft binding used to query the manifest repository is computed on the client side to avoid transmission of query asset to the lookup service. It is unlikely that a single centralized manifest repository will emerge for all content. Rather it is anticipated that decentralized model will evolve in which multiple federated manifest repositories might emerge for different industry verticals, for example a coalition of news broadcasters might maintain a federated service for soft binding lookup based upon their own manifest repositories. To promote the interoperability of independent services that query manifest repositories, we recommend that a standard communication protocol be established for clients to send queries to the soft binding lookup services and for returning manifests to clients. Trust in the lookup process is derived from trust in the integrity of the manifest repository. It may be desirable to use a decentralized, immutable data technology, such as a distributed ledger or blockchain, to underwrite the integrity of the manifest repository. C2PA prescribes cryptographic algorithms permitted for hashing (or message digest), and digital signatures both of manifests and of signing credentials. This list contains algorithms instantiated at multiple different security levels. Unless there are particular application needs or policy requirements that call for a higher security level, C2PA recommends using the following algorithms, key types, and key sizes. For hashing, C2PA recommends using SHA2-256. Standalone hashes are used in multiple places, including hard bindings of content, lists of assertions in claims, and in hashed-uri and hashed-uri-ext structures. When generating a key pair for certification in a signing credential, C2PA recommends an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) key pair on the P-256 elliptic curve or the X25519 elliptic curve. If using ECC is not desired, as an alternate, C2PA recommends an RSA key pair with a modulus length of 2048 bits. When choosing a signature algorithm for signing manifests, C2PA recommends: * ES256 (ECDSA with SHA-256) when using an ECC key pair on the P-256, P-384, or P-521 elliptic curves, * EdDSA (Ed25519) when using an ECC key pair on the X25519 elliptic curve, or * PS256 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256) when using an RSA key pair. C2PA strongly recommends that claim generators retrieve and attach time-stamps and credential freshness information at signing time. This information should be added into the COSE signature as described in the specification. Attaching a time-stamp and freshness information to the signature allows validators to conclude the manifest is still valid a) even if the signing credential has since expired or was revoked after signing time and b) without the need of an online query. In practice, C2PA claim signing keys will be issued to systems that perform claim signing operations. These systems may make these operations available to end users and/or be deployed to user-owned platforms (e.g., mobile phones). Issuance or disclosure of claim signing keys to malicious actors enables attackers to create claim signatures on arbitrary assets using the compromised identity. The resulting manifests are valid in terms of the C2PA specification, but effectively allow for spoofing provenance. It is therefore important that systems that manage C2PA claim signing keys adhere to security and key management best practices. This includes leveraging platform-specific features (e.g., hardware security modules and cloud key management services), minimizing key reuse, and revoking keys when compromise is suspected. For more information on key management, see the NIST Key Management Guidelines. Some C2PA claim generation and signing systems may be exposed to untrusted users. Exploitation or misuse of these systems may allow attackers to create claim signatures on arbitrary assets using identities provided by the system. The resulting manifests are valid in terms of the C2PA specification, but effectively allow for spoofing provenance. The impact of such an attack may be amplified if identities are shared between users, and/or if the attack goes undetected for an extended period of time. C2PA claim generation and signing systems should consider industry best practices for information security, secure development and operation, and anti-abuse practices, including leveraging available platform-specific features for deployment (e.g., Android SafetyNet, Apple DeviceCheck and AppAttest). If possible, a claim generator should attempt to validate that the signing credential used is suitable for the expected audience of validators for the asset. C2PA currently only supports X.509 certificates as signing credentials. A claim generator should be configured with the same trust anchor list and Extended Key Usage (EKU) list as the validators. Then, at signing time, the claim generator should: Validate that the certificate fulfills all the requirements for C2PA signing credentials as described Certificate Profile section of the Trust Model chapter. Validate that a chain of trust can be computed from the signing certificate to an entry in the trust anchor list using the contents of the x5chain COSE header, following the procedure in RFC 5280 section 6. This header will include both the signing certificate and any intermediate certification authorities required to build a trust chain to the trust anchor. Validate that the signing certificate is valid for one of the Extended Key Usages listed. If the claim generator is not configured with the trust anchor list and EKU list as the validators, it should not attempt any validation and sign with the provided credential. If it is so configured and validation fails, the claim generator should warn its user with an explanation of the problem, but should allow the user to choose to proceed with signing. Users may choose to sign in situations where they know their audience has a different trust anchor or EKU list configuration. C2PA claim generation and signing systems should consider industry best practices for addressing common privacy concerns of its users. The C2PA does not mandate the use of any specific \"list of certificates or CAs that can be used to verify the trustworthiness of the signer of a manifest\". There exists a variety of complexities in choosing the membership for such a list, and implementers should understand them prior to the creation of their list. The C2PA will continue to improve their guidance in this matter as the ecosystem grows. Although consumers should be able to modify the configuration of their validators, implementers should discourage consumers from adding or removing individual trust anchors. If appropriate for the application, implementers should provide users with a selection of lists they can choose from. Certain applications may have only one list of trust anchors, and others may have more than one list of trust anchors. The identity of signers will typically be established by identity providers through the use of trust lists, as there is no expectation that signers and validators will be directly known to one another. There are exceptions, however, where two users who do know one another will want to be able to validate assets signed by the other. For example, a journalist working for a well-known media organization may have a signing credential for their organization, but still wish to receive C2PA-protected assets from sources who are otherwise anonymous. The source’s validator may already trust the journalist’s credential based on its issuance from a trusted identity provider, but the source almost certainly will not have such a credential. In this case, the source can generate their own signing credential. Such a credential would not be trusted in general, as it is not issued by a recognized identity provider, but in this special case it can be communicated to the journalist, who can elect to add it to their private credential store. The private credential store is only usable for the purpose of directly trusting assets signed by a credential that would not otherwise be accepted. Credentials in the private credential store cannot act as identity providers and issue credentials for others. Implementers who want to provide this functionality should allow such a consumer to generate a credential with a simple user interface. In the case of X.509 certificates, this takes the form of a self-signed certificate. Implementers should follow the Certificate Profile in the specification when generating the certificate. Consumers can have the option to provide personally identifying information to be placed in the certificate if desired, but should not be required to do so; where such fields are required in the credential, the implementation can place non-identifying default values. Implementers should also allow the consumer to choose a validity period for the certificate after which it will become invalid, to suit the expected length of time the credential will be required. C2PA recommends a suggested default of one year. Implementers should also consumers to import and export these credentials, but stress that importing such a credential should only be permitted if the consumer has personal knowledge the credential originates from the known source. Consumers should also be directed to remove credentials when assets signed with them no longer need to be validated, or the consumer learns the signing credential has been compromised or lost. Implementers should enforce time validity periods on credentials in the private credential store, and either warn about or reject manifests signed by credentials that have expired. Implementers may provide functionality to time-stamp a single asset or otherwise mark it as requiring preservation, and continue to validate that particular manifest when needed. Consumers should only accept credentials from others with whom they have an existing relationship and an out-of-band reason to believe the credential belongs to the intended subject. Special care should be taken when implementing validators. Like other software that processes untrusted input, validators may be the target of memory safety attacks, parser attacks, request forgery attacks against adjacent systems (e.g., when retrieving remote content or decoupled manifests), information leaks (e.g., via OCSP queries), denial of service attacks, and so on. Thus, it is important that these validators adhere to secure development and operations practices associated with their respective execution environment. A manifest consumer that is performing validation (e.g., a web browser) may detect and mitigate attempted compromise of C2PA manifests or even the complete removal of C2PA manifests. It is recommended that manifest consumers consider forthcoming C2PA User Experience guidance, retrieval of decoupled manifests via soft bindings when appropriate, and other forthcoming C2PA recommendations to mitigate the impact of these types of attacks. As described in the Validation section of the specification, \"The validator may optionally recursively validate the ingredient’s ingredients\". To do so, the implementation resolves each ingredient’s url field to find the next ingredient in the chain. It is possible that an infinite recursion situation could occur during this resolution process (whether constructed on purpose as a DoS attack or not). Implementations should be careful to check for such situations when performing this recursive resolution of ingredients. The C2PA Manifest consists of data that has been serialized into either CBOR or JSON-LD. The schemas (in CDDL and JSON Schema, respectively) have been published as part of the C2PA specification website. However, those schemas exist to help implementers create valid data to improve interoperability - they should not be used as part of the standard C2PA validation process. A C2PA Validator can choose to offer schema validation as an \"extra\", but the results of that validation would not effect the validity of the C2PA Manifest. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) enable multiple parties to collaborate to produce a tamper-evident, distributed data store. DLT enables a ledger to be shared across a set of DLT nodes and synchronized between the DLT nodes using a consensus mechanism. In such a distributed system, control is distributed among the persons or organizations participating in the operation of the system (ISO 22739:2020). Data stored on a DLT is immutable; once committed to a DLT, data cannot be changed or deleted. The ordering of data stored within a DLT is also immutable. C2PA manifests store data on asset provenance that in most cases should similarly be immutable. However redaction mechanisms exist to remove past assertion data from a manifest. For example, to ensure the privacy of a creator, removing identity data from the assertion store and updating the manifest to record the event of that redaction. Other circumstances that may involve redaction could be the removal of personally identifiable information (PII) to comply with relevant legislation on data protection. Whilst the C2PA redaction mechanism provides for the deletion of data, the prior existence of that data and the act of redaction will be visible to the manifest consumer. For this reason we make a general recommendation that C2PA manifests should not be stored on DLTs, since the data immutability guarantees of DLTs prevent redaction of manifests stored within them. DLTs may, however, be used to underwrite the integrity of a manifest repository containing C2PA manifests (for example a cloud database). For example, a hash of a manifest, or other cryptographic proof, may be stored immutably within a DLT. This may be used to prove that the manifest has not been altered, or deleted (non-repudiation). We outline several possible ways that DLT may be used to implement or instantiate aspects of the C2PA specification: Underwriting the integrity of manifest stores Consider the case of an external manifest store, where manifests might stored decoupled from the digital content they describe. Such a manifest repository may be used to store manifests and query those manifests via a lookup service using either a hard or a soft binding, for example to recover provenance for assets where manifests have been removed or corrupted. The user of such a manifest repository trusts the governance of that manifest repository operator not to manipulate or remove manifests stored within. In other words, trust is centralized within the provider of the manifest repository. A DLT may be used to store hashes of manifests as they are committed to the manifest repository to assure consumers of the integrity of that manifest repository without the need to trust the manifest repository provider. A related application of DLT related to soft binding is in the creation of a federated lookup service for soft bindings. It is unlikely that a single manifest repository will exist for all manifests resolvable via soft bindings; multiple such manifest repositories are likely to emerge for any given vertical (e.g. news journalism). A distributed key-value store on DLT may resolve a soft binding to a provider running a manifest repository, which may in turn run the query and return the relevant stored manifest. Given the high throughput and low latency requirements for storing manifests, it is advisable that a Layer 2 solution or other efficient consensus mechanism for DLT (such as proof of stake, or proof of history) is used to mitigate adverse cost or energy usage. Decentralized and self-sovereign identity A separate use of DLT within the scope of C2PA might include the use of self-sovereign identity (SSI) schemes based upon DLT storage of DIDs. C2PA is agnostic to the provider of identity data and provides for the concept of an actor which is representable either via a simple identifier (such as a DID) or via a W3C Verifiable Credential (which could include a DID). In some use cases it may be preferable for users to create their own identity wallets rather than rely on a centralized or third party identity provider. In such cases DIDs stored on a DLT may provide a decentralized mechanism to ground trust in the public keys of SSI wallet holders. Decentralized signing A smart contract is a computer program stored in a DLT system wherein the outcome of any execution of the program is recorded on the distributed ledger (ISO 22739:2020). Smart contracts may be configurable via a tokenized consensus mechanism. For example, a smart contract that may be upgraded or configured according to a vote by holders of a particular cryptographic token. Such contracts are referred to as ‘decentralized autonomous organizations’ or DAOs. Like regular programs, a DAO may be used to store and process data and even take payments for doing so. A DAO might be set up to sign claims autonomously, according to a certificate installed by its operators. This would provide a decentralized alternative to the claim signing services run by centralized organizations tied to particular geographies or legislative zones. Alternatively, or in addition, a DAO might be used to set up and manage a certificate trust list. Signing of claims is grounded in public key cryptography rooted in a trust list managed by a federation of partners. Since C2PA allows for the existence of multiple such trust lists, the DLT may be leveraged to manage the trust list via a tokenized governance system. This might be attractive to content creators and consumers wishing to utilize a decentralized governance for such a list, and in turn agency over the issuance and revocation of signing certificates Digital NFTs (hereafter, NFTs) are digital tokens that represent assets - most commonly, creative works. NFTs are created and traded on distributed ledgers (DLT). NFTs represent assets via an indirection (linking) mechanism. A standard ERC-721 compliant NFT links via URI to a metadata file, that in turn links via URI to an asset. Commonly these URIs incorporate a hashed component, providing cryptographic proof for the uniqueness of the linked metadata, and the URI linking to the asset from that metadata also incorporates a hashed component. For example, the URIs are commonly content IDs (CIDs) on a distributed filesystem such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The provenance of NFT ownership is recorded through the immutable transaction history on the DLT (i.e. who currently owns or has owned the NFT). C2PA specifies a technology for describing the provenance of an asset’s creation (who created it, what was done to it, etc.). This is distinct from the provenance of NFT ownership recorded by the DLT. Much as with physical artwork, both the provenance of ownership and the provenance of creation, ascribe value to an NFT. C2PA may add value to NFTs by attesting to the provenance of their linked asset’s creation, and also leverage that provenance to mitigate the threat of that asset being misappropriated. It is common for valuable NFTs to copied and placed on the market anew (re-minting) by someone other than their creator, in order to misappropriate and potentially to gain reward for another creator’s work. C2PA provides for the assertion of identity within a manifest, and is agnostic to the identity system used. One or more identity assertions may be used to encode the wallet address(es) identifying the creator on the DLT(s) they intend to mint the asset on. When a consumer, or a marketplace, encounters an NFT with a C2PA manifest in it, they may verify that the NFT being minted or offered for sale by a particular DLT user (identified by their wallet address) matches the identifier signed into the C2PA asset. Additional checks can be made that the C2PA manifest signed to include that wallet address is known to come from a public key maintained by the content creator. This and other checks, for example on the wallet originating the minting transaction, may be used to additionally prevent spoofing or (‘sleep minting’) of NFTs. NFTs may still be misappropriated by stripping metadata including C2PA manifest from the asset, prior to minting it. This may be remediated through use of soft-bindings to recover a manifest from a manifest repository, as with general metadata stripping attacks. Items for future guidance A useful thing to add would be the steps a client audio/video player should perform to verify an actual content file for MP4/fMP4. This is currently being tracked as issue #518 the C2PA Specification github repo. The standard assertions defined for use in a C2PA Manifest include opportunities to add information about the attribution, rights and licenses of the associated asset. The following table shows which assertions and the specific fields thereof can be used for which type of information. Assertion Attribution Rights Licensing Creative Work (for all assets) author, contributor, creator copyrightHolder, copyrightNotice, copyrightYear acquireLicense, license, usageInfo IPTC Photo Metadata (for images) dc:creator, plus:ImageCreator dc:rights, plus:CopyrightOwners, xmpRights:webStatement plus:Licensor Exif information (for images) dc:creator dc:rights While adding this information to a C2PA Manifest via the standard assertions will provide a tamper-evident declaration of the information, it may also be important to include a duplicate of the information in their standard locations within assets as defined by as schema.org, IPTC or Exif standards. The reason for providing both versions is that currently existing solution won’t look for the information in the C2PA Manifest. For example, providing values for acquireLicense and license` in a Creative Work assertion will not invoke the Licensable badge in Google Images. The values would also need to be provided as structured data in the corresponding HTML page, as required by the specification of schema.org. Items for future guidance Another topic needs to be around GDPR and other related legal aspects. This is currently being tracked as issue #114 the C2PA Specification github repo. Items for future guidance Considering its potential reach and impact, specific guidance for implementations of C2PA technology in the context of social media will be developed, as discussed in issue #146 of the C2PA GitHub repo.","title":"C2PA Implementation Guidance","component":"specifications","version":"1.0","name":"Guidance","url":"/specifications/1.0/guidance/Guidance.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
