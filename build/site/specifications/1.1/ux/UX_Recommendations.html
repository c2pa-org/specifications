<h2 id="_introduction"><a class="anchor" href="#_introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The C2PA intends to provide clear guidance for implementers of provenance-enabled user experiences (UX). Developing these recommendations is an ongoing process that involves diverse stakeholders. The results will balance uniformity and familiarity with utility and flexibility for users across contexts, platforms, and devices. Our intent is to present a comprehensive range of conventions for the user experience and evolve them based on feedback. Please reference the Glossary in the <a href="../../1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary" class="xref page">C2PA Specifications</a> for clarifications on terminology used within this document. For general guidance on other areas of the specification, please see <a href="../../1.2/guidance/Guidance.html" class="xref page">Guidance for Implementors</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_principles"><a class="anchor" href="#_principles"></a>2. Principles</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UX recommendations aim to define best practices for presenting C2PA provenance to consumers. The recommendations strive to describe standard, readily recognizable experiences that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>provide asset creators a means to capture information and history about the content they are creating, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide asset consumers information and history about the content they are experiencing, thereby empowering them to understand where it came from and decide how much to trust it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User interfaces designed for the consumption of C2PA provenance must be informed by the context of the asset. C2PA have studied four primary user groups and a collection of contexts in which C2PA assets are encountered. These user groups have been defined in the <a href="https://c2pa.org/principles/">C2PA Guiding Principles</a> as Consumers, Creators, Publishers and Verifiers (or Investigators). To serve the needs of each of these groups across common contexts, exemplary user interfaces are presented for many common cases. These are recommendations, not mandates, and we expect best practices to evolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_designing_for_trust"><a class="anchor" href="#_designing_for_trust"></a>2.1. Designing for trust</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A unique aspect of this approach is that rather than attempt to determine the veracity of an asset for a user, it enables users themselves to judge by presenting the most salient and/or comprehensive provenance information. As such it is critical that users develop trust in the system itself, over the individual data presented. Exposing the C2PA Trust Model and Trust Signals in a way that balances transparency and intuitiveness is the critical design goal addressed here. There is no design pattern that can guarantee to engender trustworthiness across multiple contexts, and while a degree of contextual customization is anticipated, C2PA recommends all implementations adhere to the following general principles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_quality"><a class="anchor" href="#_quality"></a>2.2. Quality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementations should be created using industry standard, robust user interface technologies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_accessibility"><a class="anchor" href="#_accessibility"></a>2.3. Accessibility</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementations should adhere to accepted, current accessibility standards to ensure no users are excluded. For an example of such criteria, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_consistency"><a class="anchor" href="#_consistency"></a>2.4. Consistency</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wherever suitable, UX patterns should match those outlined here. In the case that this would break contextual paradigms of the platform, lean on precedent whether in the OS or app design. Users should not have to learn new paradigms or terminology in different contexts in order to access the information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_summary_vs_comprehensive"><a class="anchor" href="#_summary_vs_comprehensive"></a>2.5. Summary vs comprehensive</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many cases, a subset of the available information will be the most useful to a user in a given context. A link to the full information should always be made available, however.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_linked"><a class="anchor" href="#_linked"></a>2.6. Linked</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some data will assert an individual or organizational identity. Wherever possible, a link to information about the identity should be made available to allow the user to make a judgement on those actors' trustworthiness.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_levels_of_information_disclosure"><a class="anchor" href="#_levels_of_information_disclosure"></a>3. Levels of information disclosure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the complete set of C2PA data for a given asset can be overwhelming to a user, C2PA describes four levels of progressive disclosure which guide the designs:</p>
</div>
<div id="figure-0" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/disclosure_summary_2x.png" alt="disclosure summary 2x">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Disclosure levels</div>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Level 1 (L1)</dt>
<dd>
<p>An indication that C2PA data is present and its cryptographic validation status.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Level 2 (L2)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A summary of C2PA data available for a given asset. Should provide enough information for the particular content, user, and context to allow the consumer to understand to a sufficient degree how the asset came to its current state.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Level 3 (L3)</dt>
<dd>
<p>A detailed display of all relevant provenance data. Note that the relevance of certain items over others is contextual and determined by the UX implementer.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Level 4 (L4)</dt>
<dd>
<p>For sophisticated, forensic investigatory usage, a standalone tool capable of revealing all the granular detail of signatures and trust signals is recommended.
In addition to these standard levels, there will be common tools available for those interested in a full forensic view of the provenance data. This would reveal all available C2PA data across all manifests for an asset, including signature details.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="title">Figure 2. The L1 indicator</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_appearance"><a class="anchor" href="#_appearance"></a>4.1. Appearance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the consistency principle, it is important in developing trust that users can learn to easily recognize the presence of the system and that their expectations are met regardless of context. As such, the L1 indicator should be consistent in its appearance across all contexts and devices to the degree that it clearly represents the presence of C2PA data. L1 can be applied using only the icon, the title, or both. If using the icon alone, ensure its appearance meets accessibility criteria so that consumers can easily identify its presence on or near the C2PA-enabled content. We recommend using the placeholder “information seal” icon and working title “Content Credentials” for recognition and learned understanding of C2PA-enabled content. We may make updates to the icon and product name in upcoming versions of this document as we gather findings from on-going user research.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For content recommendations see the <a href="#interface-language">section on interface language</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_placement_and_interaction"><a class="anchor" href="#_placement_and_interaction"></a>4.2. Placement and interaction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For flexibility across implementations, there are several recommended placements for L1 indicators when C2PA-enabled content is present: on top of the content or somewhere close enough that its relationship to the content is clear. If L1 is positioned on top of the content, a hover state may be applied so as not to permanently obstruct the content below. Applications may differ depending on device, such as revealing L1 via long-press on mobile. Partially overlapping the L1 indicator over content is the most robust option to avoid potential misuse in the scenario that it has been purposefully added to content in a way meant to deceive. A new user experience guidance is recommended for initial implementation rollout to make clear how to identify L1 indicators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Behaviour of L1 indicators should reveal L2 progressive disclosure, either via a hover or click interaction. Within L2 user interfaces, L1 can continue to be used to indicate the presence of C2PA-enabled ingredients.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the event that the active manifest is invalid, a stateful indicator of data validation can be displayed. There are several scenarios when displaying a data validation state may be necessary. See Chapter 14, Validation in the <a href="../../1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation" class="xref page">C2PA Technical Specifications</a> for further information.</p>

<p>If L1 indicates the presence of C2PA data, L2 is where consumers can begin to view and interact with the data. The minimum L2 user experience is defined as the display of nothing more than the base required C2PA manifest data: the signing entity, the claim generator and date. The signer is a top trust signal that allows the consumers to make their judgement trusting that the information available has been 'backed' by a legitimate entity. C2PA anticipates that additional varying assertion data will be included by implementers, and recommends including the manifest thumbnail, signer logo, and a link to L3 where consumers can find more provenance data if available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>L2 styles, fonts, etc. can be customized to fit the given context. Iconography and terminology used to describe assertions should be consistent wherever possible. C2PA anticipates the need for L2 generally to be space-efficient as it appears within the implementer’s context. Therefore it is suggested the data displayed be streamlined to provide enough information for the particular content, user, and context, allowing the consumer to understand to a sufficient degree how the asset came to its current state.</p>

<p>In order to summarize the data in a context-specific manner, it is recommended that consideration is given to what balance of <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>breadth</strong> of data will be most relevant to users. For example, if a given piece of content has only one manifest, consider displaying more of its assertion data, as in <a href="#manifest-summary">Figure 6. A single manifest summary</a>. If there are multiple manifests, then depicting the entire provenance summary may give users a more complete understanding of the content&#8217;s history, such as in <a href="#provenance-summary">Figure 8.

<p>A manifest summary only represents a single manifest.

The determination for displaying an ingredient manifest should be if there is substantive assertion data the implementer believes is more relevant to its audience than that of the active manifest. A shortcoming of displaying a single manifest summary is that it may not represent the complete history of the C2PA-enabled content, and may require consumers to navigate away from the implementer’s context to L3 to learn more.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, the term <em>creator</em> means a party creating <em>manifests</em>. This could be the maker of an original work, an editor, or anyone else utilizing C2PA-enabled tools to add to the provenance chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As per the <a href="https://c2pa.org/principles/">C2PA Guiding Principles</a>, C2PA implementations should provide a mechanism for creators of a given content to assert, in a verifiable manner, any information they wish to disclose about the creation of that content and any actions taken since the asset’s creation. As such, the creator experience requires the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A clear acknowledgement of creator consent before a C2PA implementation can begin accumulating data;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disclosure or preview of the nature of information that is being recorded;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creator control over recorded information, with particular sensitivity to the creator’s identity and process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA recommends an opt-in flow that concisely represents these requirements and can be opted-out of just as easily at any time. Once opted-in, creators should be able to distinguish between non-removable information as defined by the C2PA specifications and information that can be adjusted according to the user’s preferences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_creator_settings_and_manifest_preview"><a class="anchor" href="#_creator_settings_and_manifest_preview"></a>7.2. Creator settings and manifest preview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creators should be able to control the information in their assertions as much as is allowed by C2PA specifications. The <a href="../../1.0/security/Harms_Modelling.html" class="xref page">Harms Modelling document</a> covers the reasoning behind why creator control is imperative. To provide coverage against harms and misuse, C2PA suggests the following types of assertions be manageable by the creator:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identity information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Fields pertaining to copyright, descriptions, and usage rights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exif information and related metadata</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be accommodating to the user’s preferences, C2PA recommends presenting a UI wherein these assertion categories can be toggled on or off on a per document basis. To assist the creator in understanding the tradeoffs they are making, C2PA also suggests displaying a manifest preview that concisely and accurately depicts what information will be added into the manifest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="identity"><a class="anchor" href="#identity"></a>7.3. Identity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The identity of the creator, or lack thereof, is an important assertion for the completion of a content’s provenance as it helps consumers understand who is responsible for what happened. It is important to restate that C2PA specifications do not require the identities of persons or organizations making any assertion about an asset to be documented. However, the challenge of validating identity when provided is beyond the scope of the C2PA specification at present. As such, C2PA recommends several tactics to help consumers understand the role of identity in C2PA provenance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is to make clear when the creator&#8217;s identity is self-assigned. The second is to offer creators the ability to add social media or other verifiable accounts. These identity flows may lie outside of C2PA creator implementations, but when included, have the added benefit of providing a degree of proof for creators as well as links to their presence elsewhere on the internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the creator decides to opt out of including their identity information, C2PA recommends promptly updating the manifest preview to reflect this change to give the creator immediate assurance their privacy is being protected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_actions"><a class="anchor" href="#_actions"></a>7.4. Actions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to the treatment of identity, some creators may want to reserve the right to not disclose the actions they’ve taken on a given piece of content. While some use cases, like photojournalism, should always show transparently what actions took place, this is less important for more creative and artistic applications. In some cases, creators may want to protect their particular creation process and should therefore be allowed to opt out of including actions in their manifests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Granularity of actions is worth considering in creator implementations. In some cases, grouping actions into high level categories may be more understandable for consumers, versus presenting a list of detailed, creation-specific actions that may be unique to the implementation. C2PA recommends striking a balance between clarity and information overload based on the intended audience of the implementing platform.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ingredients_and_their_validation_state"><a class="anchor" href="#_ingredients_and_their_validation_state"></a>7.5. Ingredients and their validation state</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ingredient assertions represent a form of non-removable information because they are the key to the establishment of the provenance of an asset and may themselves contain provenance. As such, ingredients are a requirement to be displayed in the manifest and its creator-side preview.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Validation of an ingredient&#8217;s manifest is equally important to convey to creators prior to producing a new manifest. Within the manifest preview UI, C2PA recommends displaying a list of ingredient thumbnails and their validation states to ensure the user working with those ingredients is aware of additional provenance data. This is particularly important for cases when ingredients are unable to validate or contain an invalid manifest. A clear example might be a news editor who receives a piece of user-generated content that purports to depict a controversial scene - alerting the editor to the validation state of that image will give them stronger assurances of whether that content is trustworthy.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="manifest-storage-options"><a class="anchor" href="#manifest-storage-options"></a>7.6. Manifest storage options</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to provide clear guidance about the different manifest storage options available to creators. Creators want or need to know where their manifest data is being stored, either locally or remotely, when they export their content. The following options may be presented to creators regarding the location of their manifest data:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An option indicating that the manifest will only be directly attached to and stored as part of the exported file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An option indicating that the manifest will both be directly attached to and stored as part of the exported file, and stored in a separate remote storage location.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 24. Example of manifest storage settings</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Describe each export action clearly and specifically. The action of storing remotely is more akin to “publishing to,” “storing in,” “saving to” remote storage or “publishing,” “storing,” “saving” remotely, compared to the action of storing locally or “attaching” a manifest to a file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tradeoffs between local and remote storage should be conveyed to creators, whether that be in-product or in separate documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attaching manifests to files directly generally keeps them more private. However, this comes at the expense of increased file sizes. Manifest data attached to files directly can also be stripped from those files when they are published on any platform online that processes uploaded files for size reductions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Storing manifests remotely can generally make them more resilient, persistent, and recoverable, with the added benefit of not contributing to file size. However, because remote manifest recovery is achieved through searching for soft binding matches, remotely stored manifests and their respective content can potentially be viewed by anyone. This means that remote manifest storage is inherently less private.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="../../1.2/guidance/Guidance.html" class="xref page">C2PA Implementation Guidance</a> recommends that a manifest be created for an asset when a significant event in the lifecycle of the asset takes place, such as its initial creation or an "export" operation from an editing tool. This is in part due to the underlying technical process of digitally signing the manifest, but also aligns with natural creation workflows. When a creator is ready to export their work, they should be able to decide whether or not to attach the accumulated assertion data to their content.</p>

<h4 id="_considerations_for_video_provenance"><a class="anchor" href="#_considerations_for_video_provenance"></a>8.1.3. Considerations for video provenance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Video assets present more complexities than their image counterparts. Videos may be comprised of a significant number of ingredients across multiple media types, so consideration to navigation across a provenance tree structure is warranted. It also may not be possible to show video thumbnails for the active manifest and its ingredients, since embedding video previews of these assets may lead to prohibitively large manifests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Playback of video assets may also be hampered by the fact that browsers only support a subset of the video/audio codecs that C2PA does. Additionally, some of those codecs are patent-encumbered (e.g. H.265) so even if they are transcoded into web-friendly formats for viewing from a technical standpoint, there may be some issues from a legal standpoint.</p>

<h4 id="_next_steps_for_video"><a class="anchor" href="#_next_steps_for_video"></a>8.1.4. Next steps for video</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are developing UX guidelines for a provenance-based timeline, which we anticipate providing as part of L3 recommendations in the next version of this document. As the video containing the active manifest plays, different ingredients, actions, or other time-based assertion data could be highlighted in realtime for a more immersive experience. Similarly, time-coded assertions present another navigational method for exploring provenance information.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="thumbnails"><a class="anchor" href="#thumbnails"></a>8.2. Thumbnails</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since provenance data can be added to any media type, ‘thumbnails’ here should be thought of in the broadest, multi-media sense. They should not necessarily be limited to static pixel based representations of all media types. A ‘snippet’ of audio for example could be considered all or part of a 'thumbnail’ for an audio file. Taking a multi-media, dynamic approach where possible should make thumbnails more helpful to users as they will be media appropriate. Implemented well, it will also help to aid accessibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thumbnails serve different purposes in different contexts (simple recognition, parsing large media sets, promotion etc.) but in the context of provenance the guiding principles for their inclusion should be helping users to understand the history and attribution of media and to engender trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Amongst media types (image, video, audio, docs, 3D models etc.) single image thumbnails are unique in that they are (from a user’s perspective) simply a smaller version of the actual file - a ‘complete’ yet compact instance of the same media. In our context this can be helpful since it allows users to more easily interpret provenance chains by simply scanning through these approximations. This cannot be replicated with other more complex media types and so consideration should be given to how to create meaningful but succinct representations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the media type, a meaningful ‘thumbnail’ can be comprised of more than one element (but does not need to include all). The below example uses video as an example but is intended to demonstrate how the different elements can be used to create a thumbnail of any kind.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the media, context and use case will vary we do not seek to dictate which approach is best however it is recommended that whatever approach is taken remains consistent across manifests when displaying provenance chains. Swapping between say, a <strong>PREVIEW</strong> and <strong>POSTER</strong> approach risks confusing users as to what media is being referred to. It is also recommended that whatever combination of elements (Representation, iconography, data, etc.) remains consistent across manifests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is recommended that for all media types, of the possible elements, alongside the appropriate <strong>Media representation</strong>, <strong>Iconography</strong> is always used. This should help to distinguish media types that may otherwise appear similar i.e. if an image was chosen to represent a document file it could be confused for an image file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of temporal media (audio/video/3D scene), it is also recommended that <strong>duration data</strong> is included. Duration could be helpful to a user when comparing manifests since changes to it could be meaningful. This is also a good example of the importance of consistency. If the duration is featured intermittently, this will not only make it harder to interpret, It could even result in the user mistaking some manifests as of a different media type since they have built a mental model of what to expect for a given type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The table below sets out some suggestions for how the various elements might come together to form multi-faceted ‘thumbnails’ for different media types. In the case of iconography/interactions it is acknowledged that different platforms may have existing patterns and so examples here are for illustration only.</p>

<h2 id="_communication_and_education"><a class="anchor" href="#_communication_and_education"></a>10. Communication and education</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ensure user comprehension, it is crucial that implementers consider how their audiences are introduced to C2PA provenance data and the value to be gained from engaging with it. We recommend providing creator and consumer educational experiences and strongly encourage the use of language consistent to what is provided in these guidelines. Keeping communication and education aligned is a key part of promoting comprehension, value, and adoption of C2PA data by implementers, creators, and consumers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the implementer’s platform and audience, there are different ways to effectively incorporate education around C2PA data. We suggest utilizing standard UI elements like links, tooltips, and modals to provide users with opportunities to seek out more information regarding the implementation or a component piece within. Certain L2 UI elements, like assertion categories, may warrant additional explanations to ensure user comprehension. For larger and more detailed explanations, implementers should consider linking out to FAQs or dedicated information pages so audiences can learn more about C2PA from a native product voice. However, when making content customizations, make sure things like brand voice are not prioritized in sacrifice of clarity and user comprehension.</p>

<p>Pending user research, C2PA will provide implementors with recommended L2 customizations based on combinations of content, audiences, and platforms. Examples may include news publishers, social sites, e-commerce and retail, travel, and entertainment platforms. The recommendations for video UX will also continue to expand in scope and complexity, along with the introduction of other media formats like audio and streaming content.</p>

<p>The team authoring the UX recommendations is cognizant of its limitations and potential biases, recognizing that feedback, review, user testing and ongoing evolution is a requirement for success.
