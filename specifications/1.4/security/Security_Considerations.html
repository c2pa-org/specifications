<div class="paragraph">
<p>The C2PA builds security into our designs as they are being developed, but also expects that security design and threat modelling will continue as the system, ecosystem, and threat landscape evolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this end, the C2PA uses a focused threat modelling process to support development of a strong security and privacy design. Outcomes of the effort directly support development of documentation about explicit threats and security considerations while also facilitating security-oriented thinking throughout the design process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The threat modelling process combines synchronous (i.e., live) threat modelling sessions with focused groups of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the asynchronous development of content.  The number of attendees in each synchronous session is kept small to promote efficient discussions, but all members of the C2PA have the opportunity to participate via either modality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like other security activities, we expect our threat modelling process to evolve with the C2PA ecosystem. Process documentation is considered a guide rather than a strict directive on how threat modelling works within the C2PA.</p>

<h3 id="_trust_model"><a class="anchor" href="#_trust_model"></a>2.2. Trust model</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basis of making trust decisions in C2PA, its <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model" class="xref page">Trust Model</a>, is the identity of the actor associated with the cryptographic signing key used to sign the claim in the active manifest. The identity of a signatory is not necessarily a human actor, and the identity presented may be a pseudonym, completely anonymous, or pertain to a service or trusted hardware device with its own identity, including an application running inside such a service or trusted hardware. C2PA Manifests can be validated indefinitely regardless of whether the cryptographic credentials used to sign its contents are later expired or revoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to identity, C2PA leverages trusted time-stamps to ensure the correctness of signing and revocation processes. A benefit of this approach is that revocation status can be optionally obtained when claims are generated (rather than when consumed), and revocation can be applied to subsets of signatures by time-stamp. See the <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model" class="xref page">Trust Model section of the specification</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_claim_signatures"><a class="anchor" href="#_claim_signatures"></a>2.3. Claim signatures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA uses a combination of cryptographic hashes and signatures to ensure that any tampering of the asset provenance can be detected. C2PA does not offer any protection against the <a href="#_threat_stripping_c2pa_manifests">complete removal of C2PA manifests from assets</a>, but the design does aim to prevent any unauthorized tampering of either the digital asset content or the C2PA manifests themselves. The <a href="../guidance/Guidance.html" class="xref page">C2PA Guidance document</a> for implementers offers direction about how soft bindings and manifest repositories could be used to address the removal situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Details on supported cryptographic hashing and signature schemes, as well as format details, are covered in the specification&#8217;s <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_cryptography" class="xref page">Cryptography section</a>. As noted there, the C2PA maintains lists of supported algorithms and certificate types that aim to adhere to cryptographic and compatibility best practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Detail on how signing credentials relate to identity are included in the <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model" class="xref page">Trust Model section</a> of the specification. The <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_validation" class="xref page">Validation section</a> provides details on validating claims, which includes validating signatures.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To assist the content consumer, the validator is required to maintain a list of trust anchors to facilitate validation of the certificate chain. While the validator will trust the trust anchors in their list, a content consumer may need the ability to apply a additional criteria for trust for a given situation. Therefore, the content consumer will need to be able to view the trust anchors for the content. A validator may also allow the user to create and maintain a <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_signer_credential_trust" class="xref page">private credential store</a> of signing credentials for each credential type.

<p>Some validators may be purpose-built for validating content from a finite set of sources who use a finite set of trust anchors.

<h4 id="_assumptions"><a class="anchor" href="#_assumptions"></a>4.2.1. Assumptions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following assumptions are made about entities that may attack C2PA technology:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attackers have full access to public assets and associated public metadata, including C2PA Manifests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attackers may attempt to access claim generator software (e.g., C2PA-enabled photo editing software) as a typical user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attackers do not have access to private keys referenced within the C2PA ecosystem (e.g., claim signing private keys, Time-stamping Authority private keys, etc.). They may, however, attempt to access these keys via exploitation techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attackers have the ability to publish assets to an impactful audience, for example, as a social media user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantum computing cryptanalytic attacks are considered out-of-scope.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following additional assumptions are made about the threat model:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacks that rely on bypassing conventional security models of non-C2PA technology are considered out-of-scope. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacks against the C2PA Validator as an architectural component within a user agent (e.g., web browser) are considered in-scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A compromise of the C2PA validation logic via some non-C2PA attack vector within the user agent is considered out-of-scope, since this would typically require bypassing the security model of the user agent (e.g., escaping a web browser sandbox or compromising the host via other means).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacks across conventional trust boundaries are considered in-scope.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_hardware_layer"><a class="anchor" href="#_hardware_layer"></a>4.2.2.1. Hardware layer:</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attacks against hardware implementations of C2PA would attempt to leverage the trust of the hardware manufacturer.
For example, a camera lens sends digital information to the camera’s CPU to sign what was captured. A hardware attacker might inject their own data between the lens and the camera’s CPU to convince the camera to sign fake images.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_cryptographic_pki"><a class="anchor" href="#_cryptographic_pki"></a>4.2.2.2. Cryptographic PKI</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attacks against a PKI infrastructure might leverage several techniques. A simple example of this attack would be creating a self-signed certificate that spoofs a legitimate certificate in an attempt to exploit a flaw in the validator&#8217;s implementation of trust list verification. Another example attack would be to socially engineer a certificate authority to sign content with another user’s credentials. These attacks could also include attacking the cryptographic algorithms used in the signature. Lastly, the attacker could attempt to steal a signing key either through compromising a signing service, compromising a user’s credentials to the signing service, or stealing the hardware used by the image creator. In addition to the guidance described below for specific threats, further cryptography recommendations are provided in the Trust section of the <a href="../guidance/Guidance.html#_trust" class="xref page">Guidance for Implementers</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_user_interface"><a class="anchor" href="#_user_interface"></a>4.2.2.3. User interface</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attackers targeting the user interface would create malicious manifest data that targets the user interface in which the user views the rendered content credentials. In this scenario, the attackers would embed malicious data into the C2PA metadata. When an end-user uses a user interface to view the C2PA metadata, the malicious data would be extraced from the asset and presented to the end user. This data could attempt to confuse the end-user directly. For instance, the attacker might try to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">homoglyph attacks</a> to confuse the end-user regarding the text that they are reading. Alternatively, the attacker might attempt to inject malicious data that could take control of the user interface and interfere with what is presented to the end-user. As an example, a flaw in a web-based user interface might allow the malicious manifest data to be interpreted as code by the web browser which would result in cross-site scripting. If the attacker&#8217;s malicious payload is interpeted as JavaScript by the web browser, then the attacker could manipulate the trusted user interface into presenting false information to the end-user.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_consumers"><a class="anchor" href="#_consumers"></a>4.2.2.4. Consumers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consumer attacks would focus on victimizing the human users of C2PA implementations. For instance, they might leverage how the C2PA specification allows remote manifests and references to other remote data to track and identify viewers of the content. When a person views Content Credentials, their client may make requests to these resources. If the remote resources are hosted by the attacker, the attacker could track which IP addresses have viewed specific assets. In countries where viewing certain types of content is prosecuted, this could result in the viewer’s life being put at risk. In addition, it may be possible to frame someone for viewing banned content. An attacker could take a safe image and embed a banned image containing remote C2PA metadata as an ingredient. While the user would only see the safe image, they would be flagged for looking at banned content when the manifests for the embedded ingredient are resolved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_application_implementations"><a class="anchor" href="#_application_implementations"></a>4.2.2.5. Application implementations</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These attacks would focus on exploiting the software or hardware involved in C2PA Manifest processing. An example of this type of attack would be generating a C2PA Manifest with a sufficiently large payload to perform a buffer overflow. An attacker might also include malicious manifests that result in an image being misclassified by implementations that correlates C2PA information.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_c2pa_specification"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_c2pa_specification"></a>4.2.2.6. The C2PA specification</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These attackers would have a thorough understanding in the C2PA specification and look for potential flaws in the C2PA guidance. While every effort is made to ensure that C2PA guidance is secure, a threat model would not be complete without taking into account the possibility for a mistake in the guidance or a change in the threat landscape that undermines the core tenets of the specification. Similar specifications have improved with each new version as a result of issues identified in the previous version. The threat model must take into account the possibility that the C2PA specification will have an unforeseen issue requiring an update to the specification and potential action by the C2PA community.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_community_trust"><a class="anchor" href="#_community_trust"></a>4.2.2.7. Community trust</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One method for attacking the specification is to undermine people’s trust in the technology. For instance, frequent attacks spoofing information from C2PA Manifests, while not the direct fault of the specification, could wear on the community’s patience and trust of the technology. If these attacks result in frequent efforts on the part of the end-user to verify that the content is not a spoofing attack, then they will lose patience from the extra required effort and abandon the technology. Once the community abandons the technology, attackers can revert to their original techniques for creating disinformation. The community needs be aware of malicious disruptors in the community and work to minimize their impact.</p>

<h5 id="_misrepresentation_and_assumptions"><a class="anchor" href="#_misrepresentation_and_assumptions"></a>4.2.2.8. Misrepresentation and assumptions</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These types of attacks are focused on human assumptions rather than technical attacks. For instance, one attack might be to take a photo of an image rendered by a high-definition television. The image captured by the device would be technically valid and realistic. However, without proper contextual information, a viewer of the image would assume that it was taken of a real event rather than a manufactured TV image. Similarly, there are also techniques for creating optical illusions for cameras. In these instances, the capture device correctly records and signs what came through the camera lens. However, the resulting image leads the viewer to a false conclusion about the event.</p>

<p>Each manifest has a digital signature that includes a hash of the original content. An assertion is redacted by using zeroes to overwrite the relevant section of the manifest. However, the original hash remains a part of the image via the signature. The redaction information includes information on the type of data that was redacted from the original manifest. An attacker may try to guess what was originally contained within the assertion by brute-forcing the potential values until they find a value that matches the original hash. While many bytes will have been replaced with zeroes, the standardization of the formatting means that many of those bytes will be predictable. In addition, brute forcing of all possible values may not be necessary for certain situations. For instance, an attacker may just want to confirm whether the image was created using a short list of individuals that they are interested in. Therefore, they would only need to test whether author assertions with those values match the hash. Some data types, such as geolocation, have a finite set of overall values and even smaller set of likely values if you can make certain assumptions about where the photo might have been taken. Therefore, without mitigations, it might be possible to brute force the original values of certain redacted data types.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Threat scenarios in this category aim to confuse the human consumer trying to evaluate the information being presented to them. These attacks do not violate the technical requirements of the C2PA specification. However, a malicious entity is trying to present information that misleads, confuses, or otherwise tries to establish a trust with the consumer that the consumer wouldn’t normally want to provide. For instance, this category would include impersonation attacks where an attacker is trying to impersonate a trusted entity.</p>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_description_16"><a class="anchor" href="#_description_16"></a>4.3.4.1.1. Description</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attacker tries to leverage the trust in a known entity by obtaining a certificate with the same, or similar, name. One method for this attack is for the attacker using a different certificate authority than the person that they are trying to impersonate. For instance, assume that example.org’s identitiy is provided by Alice’s Trusted Certificate Authority. An attacker may try to request an example.org certificate from Bob’s Trusted Certificate Authority. Since Alice and Bob are two different groups, the collision goes unnoticed. The consumer of the C2PA manifest may be unaware of whether example.org uses Alice or Bob’s trusted CA for their certificates. Name collisions can also occur without malicious intent when dealing with human identity since many people have the same name.</p>

<h6 id="_description_17"><a class="anchor" href="#_description_17"></a>4.3.4.2.1. Description</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA content can have multiple identities associated with it. However, those identities may not have a trust relationship. Assume that the base of the content is signed by a major, trusted news organization. Changes are then made to the content and those changes are signed by a malicious individual. The consumer of the content may assume that the malicious individual is associated with the trusted news organization, and therefore trust the content based on the news organization’s association with the content. The certificate used by the malicious individual may or may not include a common name that tries to assist in confusing the user regarding their relationship to the news organization.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When architecting your organization’s signing workflow, consider making the brand signature the final signature over the entire content. If possible, ensure that the certificates used by employees of an organization share the same certificate authority. Another approach is to create an assertion that links the two identities. A user interface needs to clearly present all identities present within C2PA content, and the order in which those identities modified the content.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section includes best practice guidance for implementors of the C2PA specification. Every implementation is unique and therefore this information is not all-inclusive.

<h3 id="_tracking_transparency_and_privacy"><a class="anchor" href="#_tracking_transparency_and_privacy"></a>5.1. Tracking, transparency, and privacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Customers should have a clear understanding about how C2PA implementations function and their supported use cases. The C2PA specification can support a wide range of use cases ranging from anonymous journalism to basic attribution for creative artists. More complex use cases may require additional protections outside the scope of this specification. C2PA implementors should be transparent with customers about the use cases that they intend to support.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One potential use case for C2PA is anonymous journalists who are at risk of physical harm if they are caught. Supporting this use case would involve protections outside of what is detailed in the C2PA specification such as legal response plans and specialized logging. If the solution is not designed to support the anonymous journalist use case, then those types of users should be able to easily discern that the solution is not appropriate for their needs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Customers will need to know how to control the generation of C2PA metadata in their content. Accidental or unintentional inclusion of metadata could cause harm to at risk groups. For instance, children are often a specialized use case due to additional legal protections and potential threats. In addition, there may be abuse victims who need to control their ability to be tracked by those who could cause them harm. Providing transparency about how to disable C2PA tracking can help protect these users.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remote C2PA content credential references could be used to track viewers of a piece of content against their will. A malicious author might intentionally use remote references to track anyone who views the image to identify their perceived enemy. One protection option is to warn the user that the content has remote credentials and obtain confirmation as to whether they want that information retrieved. If consent is granted, consider proxying the fetching of that information for the end-user. This action would prevent the end-user’s IP address from being disclosed to the remote site. Regardless of implementation, it is encouraged to inform content consumers how data will be fetched.</p>

<h4 id="_separation_of_identities"><a class="anchor" href="#_separation_of_identities"></a>5.1.2. Separation of identities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Content authors may need to be able to support multiple profiles for different use cases. Freelance artists and journalists may work for more than one employer and may need to split their identities to reflect their different employment situations. People may also want to split their professional and personal identities. Lastly, certain types of artists may want to publish using a pseudonym, such as a nom de plume or stage name.  Therefore, provide clarity to end-users about how to best control their identities and the identity of their devices.</p>

<h3 id="_incident_response"><a class="anchor" href="#_incident_response"></a>5.2. Incident response</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is likely that highly skilled and highly resourced adversaries will be targeting C2PA infrastructure. Therefore, C2PA implementations should have incident response plans for when they are targeted. Incident response plans should be prepared for all aspects of the C2PA implementation and ecosystem. A breach could occur in the implementation’s software or hosting environment. There could be a breach of an end-user, such as an account compromise. In addition, there could be a breach of C2PA dependency, such as a certificate authority. Practice executing the incident response plans on a regular basis to ensure that any attack can be quickly mitigated with minimal system impact.</p>
