<h2 id="_introduction"><a class="anchor" href="#_introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestation is a platform security feature that allows software to prove its identity and the
identity and/or security characteristics of the device or platform on which
it is running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current C2PA trust model is primarily designed to enable persons or organizations
to make claims about digital assets and their associated metadata.  Attestation extends the C2PA trust model to allow relying parties to determine the software and devices that are involved in the creation or processing of a digital asset.  These additional trust signals can supplement or replace the person/organization-based trust signals that are currently defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This specification describes how to add attestation signals and measurements to C2PA-marked assets.  C2PA seeks feedback on this proposal, especially from implementers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestation is a rapidly evolving field. At the time of writing, there are several widely deployed but non-interoperable technologies and protocols.  There are also several initiatives to improve interoperability, but all current proposals involve new trust-broker-style services, which which are under development.  This specification takes a pragmatic approach: it defines general-purpose data structures that support current technologies and known upcoming standards and systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_outline"><a class="anchor" href="#_outline"></a>1.1. Outline</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document is organized as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><a href="#_glossary">Chapter 2</a> contains a glossary of attestation-related terms used in this specification. This document also uses terms defined in the C2PA specification <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary">C2PA Glossary</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#_c2pa_trust_model_overview">Chapter 3</a> and <a href="#_attestation_overview">Chapter 4</a> describe the existing C2PA trust model and provide an introduction to attestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#_scenarios">Chapter 5</a> describes some motivating scenarios using different types of attestation technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#_implicit_attestation">Chapter 6</a> and <a href="#_explicit_attestation">Explicit Attestation</a> are the main normative parts of the specification.  These chapters describe two different approaches to adding attestation to C2PA data structures.  The architecture and data structures described in these chapters are attestation-technology-agnostic.  <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a> provides information on how the currently supported attestation technologies can be used, and how the resulting attestations are encoded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#_trust_roots_for_attestation">Chapter 8</a> contains considerations for how C2PA Trust Roots should be supplemented to enable interoperable attestation creation and verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#_implementation_considerations">Chapter 9</a> provides guidance for selecting an attestation technology and choosing how to encode the attestation evidence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This specification assumes a working understanding of the C2PA architecture and data structures: in particular, Claims, Assertions,  Claim Signatures and how these data objects are packaged into C2PA manifests. This specification also assumes some understanding of attestation technologies.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_glossary"><a class="anchor" href="#_glossary"></a>2. Glossary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter contains a glossary of terms used in this document.  Additional C2PA-related terms are defined in <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary">C2PA Glossary</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_attestation" class="discrete">Attestation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestation (verb) is the process of making claims about the security properties of a device, program, or execution environment.  In the context of this specification, attestation is built on digital signatures from trusted attestation providers.  An attestation (noun) is security claim about a program or device.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_attestation_provider" class="discrete">Attestation Provider</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A trustworthy local or remote entity that generates Attestations. A local attestation provider is typically a Root of Trust on a device.  A remote Attestation Provider is called a Trust Broker in this specification.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_attestation_evidence" class="discrete">Attestation Evidence</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attestation generated by a local Attestation Provider - i.e., a Root of Trust on the device. Attestation Evidence can be directly consumed by <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary">C2PA Validators</a> or or by Trust Brokers.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_attestation_verdict" class="discrete">Attestation Verdict.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Attestation Verdict is the information returned by a Trust Broker, e.g., a RATS Verifier, after the appraisal of Attestation Evidence. In RATS terminology it is known as Attestation Results.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_eat" class="discrete">EAT</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) is a claims set that describes state and characteristics of a hardware/software component. EATs are used by relying parties, servers or services to determine how much they wish to trust the entity. An EAT is either a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or JSON Web Token (JWT) with attestation-oriented claims. For more detail see: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-eat-18.pdf">The Entity Attestation Token</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_explicit_attestation" class="discrete">Explicit Attestation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explicit Attestations are signatures over user-provided data and claims about the security state of the platform or application, combined to form an evidence.  Platforms doing explicit attestation contain a Root of Trust with a signing key that signs data structure containing application-provided data (for example, the hash of a C2PA Claim) together with measurements/statements of the application and the platform environment where it is running.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_implicit_attestation_key_attestation" class="discrete">Implicit Attestation (Key Attestation)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implicit Attestations are digital signatures using keys that are only available to trusted devices and applications. Because only trusted applications can use these keys, a digital signature using one of the keys <em>implies</em> the identity of the application processed the Claim.  The keys used for implicit attestation can be embedded during manufacture or can be created/certified in the field.  In the latter case, Explicit Attestations are often used to prove that Implicit Attestation keys are being managed by trusted software on known or authorized hardware.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_quote" class="discrete">Quote</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Quote is the name given to the raw attestation evidence provided by TPMs, SGX Enclaves, and many other attestation providers. Quotes are digital signatures over user-supplied data (a Claim-hash, in this setting) as well as measurements of the application/execution environment that requested the quote-operation.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_sealing" class="discrete">Sealing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sealing is a security primitive that allows an application to limit the application and devices that can access the sealed data.  In this specification, Sealing can be used to ensure that only authorized applications can access keys used for Implicit Attestation.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_remote_attestation_procedures_rats" class="discrete">Remote Attestation procedureS (RATS)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS) is a framework and architecture for unifying and simplifying the use of attestation in distributed systems.  RATS defines a trusted intermediary, called a RATS Verifier (A Trust Broker, in the terminology of this specification) to hide the complexity of attestation primitives and policies from relying parties. RATS is defined in: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rats-architecture">RATS Architecture</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_root_of_trust" class="discrete">Root of Trust</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Root of Trust is a hardware or software component that is trusted to perform a critical security function.  Roots of Trust are typically used to vouch for the device or software running on the device: i.e., to generate attestations.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="_tpm_tpm_2_0" class="discrete">TPM / TPM 2.0</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Trusted Platform Module (TPM, also known as ISO/IEC 11889) is a widely adopted international standard for a Root of Trust.  TPMs can be implemented as discrete components, can be integrated into SoCs, or can be implemented in firmware running in a protected mode or environment on an application processor. See:  <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/"> TPM 2.0 Library | Trusted Computing Group</a></p>
</div>
<h3 id="_trust_broker" class="discrete">Trust Broker</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trust Broker is the generic term for an attestation verification service. IETF RATS Verifiers and Google Play Integrity services are examples of Trust Brokers.  Trust Brokers evaluate Attestation Evidence produced by Local Attestation Providers and return Attestation Verdicts which are incorporated into C2PA Manifests.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A C2PA Claim Signature is a simple digital signature over a CBOR-serialized C2PA Claim.  This signature allows relying parties to verify the signer, and that the claim (and referenced assertions, and the asset) have not been modified.  In the current version of the specification, Claim Signers-keys are supported by an X.509-based PKI.  C2PA does not specify trust roots: these are defined by other entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA also supports optional time-stamping.  A C2PA Timestamp is a countersignature over the CBOR-serialized C2PA Claim: effectively, the Claim is signed twice: once by the Claim Signer, and once by the time-stamping service on behalf of the Claim Signer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the current version of the C2PA main specification, Claim Signing keys and their associated certificates can be associated with people, organizations or devices. This specification describes how the existing C2PA Claim Signing keys can be managed so that the resulting signature conveys information about the Claim Signer and characteristics of the security environment in which it is running.  This is called <em>Implicit Attestation</em> (<a href="#_implicit_attestation">Chapter 6</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This specification also describes how evidence from attestation providers can be added to a Claim with a normal Claim signature (<a href="#_explicit_attestation">Explicit Attestation</a>).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_attestation_overview"><a class="anchor" href="#_attestation_overview"></a>4. Attestation Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A well-formed C2PA Claim Signature demonstrates that the Claim Creator had access to the Claim Signing key when the Manifest was created.  If the Claim Signing key can only be used by a single entity, then the Claim Signature demonstrates that the Claim Creator was that entity. In most cases, access to Claim Signing Keys (or any key that is used to create digital signatures) is carefully controlled.  For example, an enterprise might only allow certain trusted employees to sign assets.  This allows  relying parties to infer that a properly signed asset was published by that organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestation, in the context of C2PA, seeks to refine this Trust Model to allow relying parties to infer more information about the <em>device or application</em> that created Claim and Manifest. The additional information might include:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The specific device that created the Claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>class</em> of device that created the Claim, without revealing the specific device (to preserve privacy.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application that created the Claim.  This might be a specific application identified by a cryptographic digest, a family of applications identified by a signing key or certificate, or a publisher, identified by a unique name in the context of an app-store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The security properties of the environment in which the app is running.  This might include the operating system that is hosting the application as well as its security configuration (e.g. non-rooted or no admin-access.) In some cases, the security environment is provided by the CPU vendor with little or no additional software, in which case the security properties might included whether the "enclave" is debuggable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional information may supplement or replace the information conventionally conveyed by a Claim Signature (i.e., the organization or person that created the Claim.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As previously noted, this specification describes two approaches to conveying attestation signals, called <em>Implicit</em> and <em>Explicit</em> attestations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Implicit Attestation is a conventional Claim Signature, but using a key that is only accessible to authorized platforms and applications.  This is described in <a href="#_implicit_attestation">Chapter 6</a>. <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Explicit Attestation is a special sort of signature that conveys evidence about the current security posture of the platform or application that requested the signature. Explicit Attestation-capable platforms contain a special sort of signing key, usually called an attestation key. Attestation keys cannot be used to generate simple signatures; instead they sign a combination of user/application-supplied data, together with measurements (or other sort of description) of the application that requested the signature and information about the environment in which it is running. Most platforms that provide attestation capabilities refer to these specialized signatures as <em>quotes</em> and call the signing operation <em>quoting</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explicit Attestation works slightly differently than Implicit Attestation does.  Attestation-capable platforms provide a special sort of signing key, usually called an attestation key, that can be used by more than one application/operating system.  However, if the attestation key is used to sign data, then the digital signature also conveys measurements of the application that requested the signature.
Most platforms that provide attestation capabilities refer to these specialized signature as <em>quotes</em> and call the signing operation <em>quoting</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TPM quote-operations are a signature over some application-provided data
together with an encoding of current Platform Configuration Registers (PCR)
values. Compliant platforms record measurements of the booting software into the PCRs,
so the TPM quote reports reflects the software running on the platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Android Play Integrity is a system/cloud-service that allows app-developers
to generate signed statements indicating the package that requested the
integrity verdict, as well information about the security posture of the
requesting device - e.g., the running operating system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intel&#8217;s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides a reporting/quoting
feature that is a signature over the measurement of the code that was
loaded into the enclave, as well as other critical security settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ARM&#8217;s Platform Security Architecture (PSA) provides the
calling application with attestation tokens that contain security claims about the underlying platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestations can be directly consumed by relying parties or can be forwarded
to a Trust Broker (a Verification Service) where they are translated into an easier-to-understand form, sometime called an Attestation Verdict.
For example, Android Play Integrity verdicts use a Google-provided
Trust Broker service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This specification allow Explicit Attestations in the form of quote-style signatures to be embedded directly into Claims.  This is described in <a href="#_explicit_attestation">Explicit Attestation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keys for Implicit Attestation may be provisioned at the time of device manufacture, but more commonly, quote-style attestations are used to enrol and certify Implicit Attestation keys. The advantage of this is that new keys can be enrolled when the device is in the field.  This specification does not define suitable protocols, but general considerations secure key enrolment/provisioning are described in <a href="#_issuing_certifying_keys_for_implicit_attestation">Section 6.2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_trust_brokers_and_rats"><a class="anchor" href="#_trust_brokers_and_rats"></a>4.1. Trust Brokers and RATS</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RATS, or Remote Attestation Procedures, is an IETF specification for a Trust Broker that seeks to improve interoperability between differing attestation systems (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9334" class="bare">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9334</a>).  In RATS, the trusted service is called The <em>Verifier</em>, and acts as a trusted intermediary between The <em>Attester</em> (the device or service that creates a C2PA asset) and the <em>Relying Party</em> that seeks to make a trust assessment about a program or environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA specifications use the terms <em>Validator</em> and <em>Verifier</em> for relying parties.  To avoid confusion, this specification uses the term <em>Trust Broker</em> to indicate a RATS Verifier or similar service such as Google&#8217;s PlayIntegrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trust Brokers are an important building block for enabling an open ecosystem of attestation-enabled asset creators and attestation-aware relying parties.  Trust Brokers must be aware of a diverse set of platform types, applications, operating systems, and security policies.  But if their policy requirement are met, then they can translate the raw-attestations into much simpler claims for C2PA validators (e.g., "Trusted Camera App running on Android 11.")</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expectation is that RATS-style Trust Brokers will simplify adoption of attestation technologies by open ecosystems.  However, at the time of writing, the RATS ecosystem is still in its infancy.  Because of this, current specification supports both raw attestation evidence (e.g., "quotes") as well as RATS-style "verdicts."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestation can be used to distinguish imagery captured by a trusted camera and imagery created or manipulated by other applications and services.

attestations can be added to demonstrate that a model or inference was
trained or run in a secure environment.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes the design considerations and normative requirements for incorporating implicit attestations into the C2PA trust model.  The chapter than follows - <a href="#_explicit_attestation">Explicit Attestation</a> - describes Explicit Attestation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implicit Attestation (sometimes called Key Attestation), in the context of this specification, involves the use of a signing key that can only be used by an authorized application running on an authorized device.  If the signing key can only be used by the authorized application on the authorized devices, then the presence of a well-formed signature in a manifest <em>implies</em> that the authorized application signed the Claim.  I.e., the Claim-Signing application has been <em>implicitly attested</em>.  Keys with these security properties are called Implicit Attestation keys, or <em>IA-keys</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IA key is used to sign a Claim in exactly the same way as Claims are normally signed.  I.e., the signature is calculated over the serialized Claim, and the resulting Claim Signature is packaged in the manifest identically to other Claim Signatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This specification also allows an IA-key signature to be embedded in an attestation assertion as an alternative to incorporating it as a Claim Signature.  This is described in <a href="#_implicit_attestation_assertions">Section 7.5</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

<p>This specification provides guidance but no normative requirements for the issuance and lifetime management of Implicit Attestation keys. Implementers should consult platform-specific documentation for detailed protocol descriptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Devices that support attestation provide cryptographic building blocks that can be used in protocols to prove the identity of the device and running software to relying parties. One common cryptographic primitive is usually called <em>Quote</em>. Quotes are digital signatures over user-supplied data and platform/quote-engine-supplied data that describes the running program and the security properties of the environment in which it is executing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quotes (and related primitives) can be used to create Explicit Attestations (<a href="#_explicit_attestation">Explicit Attestation</a>) but can also be used in a protocol to provision or certify an Implicit Attestation key.  A commonly used protocol fragment is that an application creates a key-pair and “Quotes” the resulting public key.  The public key and quote is sent to a trusted service that decodes the quote to check that the device is known or in good-standing, and that the program measurements conveyed in the quote are in policy.  If the checks succeed, the service creates a certificate for the newly created Implicit Attestation public key.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>It is assumed that devices are provisioned with a platform key and certificate (or a platform key and a pre-established trust relationship with a server.) This step is usually performed during manufacture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point in the life of the device, the C2PA-compliant Claim Creator application is installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During installation (or later), the Claim Creator will interact with a trusted service to create a certified key known as "certified IA-key" for signing Claims. The certified key is derived from platform key as its root. The Claim Creator uses an Attestation Protocol to prove that it is an authorized application (permitted to use the certified key) running on a trusted device. Hence the Application is now directly or indirectly associated to the platform key in (1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The certified IA-key and certificate can be used immediately to sign Claims or Partial Claims.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes how an attestation can be created and embedded as an assertion.  This contrast with the architecture described in the Implicit Attestation section where the (implicit) attestation is conveyed as a Claim Signature.  Implementation considerations for choosing Implicit vs. Explicit Attestation is discussed in section <a href="#_what_is_attested">Section 7.1</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current C2PA trust model is built using two signatures:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A signature over a CBOR-serialized Claim.  The signature is encoded in the Manifest, and the certificate chain for the signing key is usually also included.</p>

<li>
<p>Optionally, a countersignature from an <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt">RFC 3161</a>-compliant time stamping service.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestations, in the context of this document, are also digital signatures.  This section describes options for how the additional attestation signature(s) can be added to the two that are already defined.  Note that the discussion in this section is simplified: later sections present the complete design and normative requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the following, when a statement say <em>"attestation over data X"</em> it implies that the attestation is a signature over the hash of the serialization of X, and also attestation-engine-supplied measurements or claims about the platform and/or application that requested the attestation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest option for adding an attestation would be to include it as a second countersignature over the C2PA Claim (as data X above).  However, with this design, the Claim Signature or the attestation can be independently removed and replaced. Whether these attacks are troublesome will depend on scenario (and the sophistication of the C2PA Relying Party), which makes a thorough security analysis difficult. However, the following proposal prevents the attestation and claim signatures being independently replaced with only modest complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve the Claim-Signature/attestation binding, the following procedure is used:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>An attestation over the serialized <em>partial C2PA Claim</em> is performed first and then the claim signature is performed over the complete C2PA Claim that contains attestation.  This prevents the attestation being removed or replaced independently of the Claim Signature, because any modification of the attestation will invalidate the Claim Signature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent the Claim Signature being replaced, the attestation can optionally contain the public key of the subsequent Claim Signer.  This means that validators can detect and reject a Claim Signature if the Claim Signature key specified in the attestation does not match the keys used for the actual Claim Signature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To summarize: The Claim Signer signs the attestation, which prevents tampering of the attestation. The attestation contains the public key of the Claim Signer, so the Claim Signature cannot be replaced with a signature using a different key.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_attested"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_is_attested"></a>7.1. What is Attested?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Claim Signatures are calculated over the serialization of a Claim, and the Claim itself is cryptographically linked to its embedded Assertions.  Two types of Assertion are important here: Assertions that contain metadata, and Assertions that bind a Claim to an Asset with a hash or hashes of an Asset or Asset fragment (a "hard binding").  By signing the Claim, the Claim Creator vouches for both the asset (via the binding Assertion) and the metadata.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar bindings exists for the explicit attestation signature: i.e., the attestation vouches for the Asset and the metadata. Note that most or all scenarios benefit from binding to the Asset (e.g., for the Trusted Camera Application, <em>“this image was captured by this program running on this device.”</em>)  Some scenarios will benefit from binding to metadata assertions (e.g., for a Trusted Camera Application <em>“the GPS coordinates obtained from the radio when this image was captured”</em> or for the ML scenario, <em>“the following objects were recognized in the image.”</em>)  However, note that attestation will <em>not</em> improve trust for all types of assertion data: for example, user-input is hearsay as far as the attesting application is concerned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach in this specification is that the attestation is over the serialization of the entire Claim – i.e., the same data structure that the Claim Generator signs (with one exception, which is described below).  As noted above, not all Assertions/metadata gain security benefit from the attestation, but signing all assertions provides the most flexibility for future scenarios. For future advanced use cases, the specification defines a field that an attestation generator can use to indicate which assertions are meaningfully “attested.” However, the use and interpretation of this field is beyond the current scope of C2PA.</p>

<h3 id="_embedding_an_explicit_attestation_in_a_manifest"><a class="anchor" href="#_embedding_an_explicit_attestation_in_a_manifest"></a>7.2. Embedding an Explicit Attestation in a Manifest</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explicit attestations are similar to Claim Signatures and could be encoded in a manifest similarly.  However, there is also an additional security requirement noted earlier: i.e., that the Claim Signer should also sign the attestation result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A natural way of encoding the attestation so that it is signed by the Claim Signer is to embed it as an assertion in the Claim.  However with this method, then the attestation will naturally be signed in the same way as any other Assertion.  However, naïve attempts at implementing this method will fail, as it introduces a circular dependency: the Claim cannot be finalized before the attestation is created, but the attestation requires a finalized Claim in order to calculate the Claim hash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The specification break this dependency by specifying that the attestation is created over the hash of the serialized claim but <strong>omitting the attestation assertion</strong> (which has not been created yet.)  Once the attestation has been created, it is embedded in the Manifest and Claim identically to any other assertion and will subsequently be signed by the Claim Creator.  The Claim with one or more attestation assertions elided is called a <em>Partial Claim</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This architecture is attractive because normal Claim creation and Claim Validation are unaffected.  It is also attractive because an attestation-enhanced claim can be processed by an attestation-unaware validator without changes (the attestation assertion can be treated like any other third-party or unrecognized assertion.)</p>

<div class="title">Figure 2. Simplified Steps</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above figure shows simplified steps for creating a C2PA Manifest containing an Attestation Assertion. In the no-attestation case, Assertions are created and stored in the Assertion Store.  Next, a Claim is then prepared, with the <code>assertions</code> array set to the location and hash of the referenced assertions. The Claim is then serialized, hashed, and signed by the Claim Generator, yielding the Claim Signature.  The Assertion Store, Claim, and Claim Signature are then packaged as a C2PA manifest (not shown.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support explicit attestations, the additional steps in the shaded box are required. As before, an Assertion Store is populated with the desired assertions, but it is referred to as a Partial Claim because one additional Assertion will be added before the Claim is finalized.  The Partial Claim is then serialized and the Partial-Claim&#8217;s hash (which is generated using the same methodology as a standard Claim) is then attested using the appropriate platform attestation service. Next, the Attestation is packaged as an Attestation Assertion and added to the Assertion Store to create a finalized Assertion Store.  Finally, the complete Claim (with the embedded Attestation Assertion) is signed by the Claim Generator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This architecture requires that attestation-aware validators perform additional steps: Specifically, validators must internally modify the Claim to remove any attestation assertions to produce a Partial Claim that can then be used to validate the bindings in the attestation assertion.  This tradeoff is considered to be acceptable: the rewriting cost is borne by the creators and consumers of attestations, but the creation and validation workflow for non-attestation-aware entities is unchanged.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If more than one attestation is required then they are ordered and each subsequent attestation is over the Partial Claim containing the prior attestations.  For example, if two attestations are required,
the first attestation to be added will be over the Partial Claim with no attestation assertions.  The first attestation assertion is then added to the Claim, and the resulting data structure becomes the user data input (partial Claim) for the second attestation.  Of course, the second attestation assertion is then added, and the resulting finalized Claim is signed by the Claim Creator.</p>

<p>Attesters that wish to include multiple attestations are free to decide the order that they are created and embedded, but since later attestations include earlier attestations, the validation order must be the same as the creation order.

<h3 id="_implicit_attestation_assertions"><a class="anchor" href="#_implicit_attestation_assertions"></a>7.5. Implicit Attestation Assertions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#_implicit_attestation">Chapter 6</a> describes Implicit Attestation in detail, but briefly, an Implicit Attestation is a simple signature (i.e., not a <em>"quote"</em>) using a key that is only accessible to authorized applications running on authorized devices.  If the key can only be used by trusted applications, then the presence of a well-formed Claim Signature <em>implies</em> that the trusted app signed the Claim.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#_implicit_attestation_requirements">Section 6.1</a> describes how Implicit Attestations can be encoded as Claim Signatures.  This is simple and straightforward, but C2PA does not support multiple Claim Signatures in a Manifest so may not be suitable when the Claim Creator needs to convey both the (organization- or human-) Claim Signer <em>and</em> the application+device on which the Manifest was created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To remedy this, the specification also allows Implicit Attestations to be encoded in Attestation Assertions, in exactly the same way that Explicit Attestations are supported.  When using this option, rather than using a quote-style signature, the signature is created using an Implicit Attestation key: e.g., a key that is associated with a trusted application running on a trusted device.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestation Assertions for Implicit Attestations are distinguished using the <code>type</code> field.  Implicit Attestations use the attestation type <code>c2pa.embedded-implicit</code> and the actual signature is embedded in the <code>attestation-info-map.att-result</code> field.  Details are provided in <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<h5 id="_partial_claim_definition"><a class="anchor" href="#_partial_claim_definition"></a>7.6.1.1. Partial Claim Definition</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Partial Claim is a C2PA <code>claim-map</code> but omitting any Attestation Assertions. (Note: for simplicity it is stated that an assertion is “included” or “omitted”, but what is actually added or omitted from the Claim is actually a <code>hashed-uri-map</code> link in the <code>assertions</code> array).  Partial Claims use the same <code>claim-map</code> data structure as a standard Claim: a Partial Claim only differs in that one or more Attestation Assertions are removed from the <code>assertions</code> array.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attestation Assertions can be included at any location in the assertion array, although placing them last in the assertions array simplifies processing and is therefore preferred.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During Claim creation, the attestations are calculated then embedded one at a time.  For example, the Partial Claim without attestation assertions is created, serialized, and then the first attestation is gathered.  The resulting attestation result is then encoded as an <code>attestation-info-map</code> assertion and then added to the end of the <code>assertions</code> array in the Partial Claim form the finalized Claim.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a second attestation is required, the Partial Claim with the first Attestation Assertion included is serialized and the second attestation is performed.  The second Attestation Assertion is encoded in a <code>attestation-info-map</code> then added to the end of the <code>assertions</code> array to form the final Claim, which is then signed by the Claim Creator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This specification does not restrict the location in the <code>assertions</code> array where the Attestation Assertions are added,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> although, as previously noted, incorporating them last in the array is preferred. However, the order in the <code>assertions</code> array is important when more than one Attestation Assertion is incorporated.  In this case, higher-index Attestation Assertions are performed after lower-index entries.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter contains implementation notes and some tradeoffs to consider when choosing an attestation technology and embedding scheme. A thorough working knowledge of the relevant attestation technologies is assumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_attestation_technology"><a class="anchor" href="#_attestation_technology"></a>9.1. Attestation Technology</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variety of hardware-based attestation technologies are available.  Most platforms offer just one choice, although some platforms have two.  For example, many platforms contain a TPM that can attest the "rich OS", and some contain an additional attestation root for reporting the software running in a protected enclave.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System architects may consider the following factors when choosing an attestation technology:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>What is available? The platform may only offer one attestation technology.  For example, a TPM may be the only attestation technology available on a platform.  In this case, the choice is made for the system architect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which System Services need to be "trusted?" Some aspects of Claim Creation can be performed without use of external services.  For example, creating asset-bindings (hashes) can be implemented entirely by the Claim Creator without the use of OS services.  However, some scenarios benefit from attesting that data was securely obtained from IO devices such as a camera sensor or GPS receiver. If attestation is to increase trust in data "passed in" from outside the Claim Creator application, then the device or OS that provides this data must be attested, be immutable, or be authenticated. This is generally simplest when the whole OS is attested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online or Offline?  Some attestation technologies (PlayIntegrity, RATS) require an online connection to a server create an attestation.  Others can create attestations offline.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="_implicit_or_explicit_attestation"><a class="anchor" href="#_implicit_or_explicit_attestation"></a>9.2. Implicit or Explicit Attestation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explicit Attestations are created at the time of Claim Creation and are bundled in the manifest.  Explicit attestations supplement a conventional Claim Signature and are bound to it so that neither the attestation or the Claim Signature can be independently stripped or replaced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implicit Attestation is a Signature with a key that was provisioned for the Claim Creator using attestation primitives, but reflects some past security configuration for the platform or Claim Creator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System architects may consider the following factors when choosing between Implicit and Explicit attestations:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_availability_of_suitable_sealing_primitives"><a class="anchor" href="#_availability_of_suitable_sealing_primitives"></a>9.2.1. Availability of Suitable Sealing Primitives</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implicit attestation requires that the Implicit Attestation Key (IA-Key) be protected (i.e., only accessible to the authorized Claim Creator) from the point of provisioning to the point of use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most platforms that support attestation also support sealing primitives that can be used to protect the IA-Key when the Claim Creator is not running.  For example, the TPM supports sealing to PCR values that define the security configuration, and Intel SGX supports sealing to enclave state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implicit attestation works best when suitable sealing primitives are available.  If no suitable sealing primitives are available, then short-lived IA-keys may be used.  For example, each time the attesting Claim Creator is launched it could obtain a new certified Implicit Attestation key and never persist it to storage.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="_online_or_offline_claim_creation"><a class="anchor" href="#_online_or_offline_claim_creation"></a>9.2.2. Online or Offline Claim Creation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When suitable sealing primitives are available, Implicit Attestation can generally be performed offline: it is just a simple signature using the IA-key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether Explicit Attestation can be performed offline will depend on the attestation technology used. For example, a "raw" TPM quote can be obtained offline, while a PlayIntegrity attestation requires an online connection to a PlayIntegrity server.  Similarly, a RATS attestation requires an online connection to a RATS server when the attestation is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System architects should consider whether online connections at the time of attestation creation are available and acceptable when selecting an attestation technology and embedding scheme.</p>

<h3 id="_rats_or_native_attestations"><a class="anchor" href="#_rats_or_native_attestations"></a>9.3. RATS or Native Attestations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RATS (Remote Attestation Procedures) is a suite of technologies and protocols that allow a third-party verifier to translate a diverse set of "raw" attestations into simpler and easier-to-understand trust assessments.  I.e., RATS will generally relieve the Claim Validator of the need to understand the details of the attestation technology and acceptable attestation measurements used by the Claim Creator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is generally a good thing, but it comes at the cost of:</p>

<p>Explicit attestation requires additional steps, with implications for both Claim Creation time and memory usage.  Explicit attestation requires that a Partial Claim be constructed, attested, and bundled/embedded as an assertion.  (This may be repeated if more than one attestation is required.) Once the final Claim is available, it is signed as usual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Claim Creator must protect the Claim as it passes from a Partial Claim to a finalized Claim with a Claim Signature.

<h3 id="multi-pass-data-hash"><a class="anchor" href="#multi-pass-data-hash"></a>9.7. Multiple-Step Processing With a Data Hash Assertion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a C2PA Manifest uses a <code>c2pa.hash.data</code> assertion for the hard binding to the media, there is an interdependency between the hard binding assertion and the attestation assertion. This interdependency can be summarized by highlighting two key steps in the process:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The <code>c2pa.attestation</code> assertion contains a hash of the Partial Claim, which in turn contains a hash of the <code>c2pa.hash.data</code> assertion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>c2pa.hash.data</code> assertion contains an <code>exclusions</code> field in it, which implicitly encodes the size of the C2PA Manifest. But the size of the C2PA Manifest will change when the <code>c2pa.attestation</code> assertion is finalized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The contents of the <code>c2pa.attestation</code> assertion depends on the contents of the <code>c2pa.hash.data</code> assertion, which depends on the size of the <code>c2pa.attestation</code> assertion. The solution to the problem is to use padding.  For example, the <code>pad</code> and <code>pad2</code> fields of the <code>attestation-info-map</code> can be used to add padding to the <code>c2pa.attestation</code> assertion before finalizing the <code>exclusions</code> field of the <code>c2pa.hash.data</code>. A procedure for accomplishing this is described in <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_multiple_step_processing">Section 11.4</a> of the C2PA specification.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hashing_jumbf_boxes">Section 8.3.1.3</a>, the C2PA specification describes a method for adding salt to assertions before constructing the Claim. Since this salt is part of the JUMBF structure, and not part of the assertion data, some implementations might not store this salt in internal (deserialized) structures, and might just generate it as part of the serialization to JUMBF process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In such implementations, it is possible that the salt value could change between the process of serializing the JUMBF structure for the Partial Claim, vs. serializing the JUMBF structure for the full Claim that will be signed by the C2PA Signature. If the salt changes between these two steps, then the Claim&#8217;s hashes for each assertion will also change, and the <code>c2pa.attestation</code> assertion will fail verification.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>SafetyNet Attestation API</strong> - This API has been deprecated and replaced by the Play Integrity API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Play Integrity API</strong> - Attestations received via this API are primarily intended to verify "internal" communications between collaborative application services, and are not designed to be ingested by a 3rd party. There are two problems associated with Play Integrity attestations that limit their applicability for C2PA attestation:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>integrity verdict</em> provided by Play Integrity is wrapped in JWE (JSON Web Encryption).

</li>
<li>
<p>Once the <em>integrity verdict</em> is decrypted, it contains a JWS (JSON Web Signature) which must be verified with the proper public key.

<p>With the quote verified, inspect the quote and examine its contents. Remember that quote verification merely tells whether the quote is valid, and whether there are issues with the remote enclave’s TCB. Trusting the quote is not the same as trusting the enclave: to make a trust decision about the enclave, its metadata must be examined and, at minimum, answer the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is this enclave one that can be recognized? Specifically, can verification recognize MRSIGNER, MRENCLAVE, and the vendor-specific identifiers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the debug attribute set?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the quoting enclave one that can be identified? And is it up to date?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the enclave’s software version up to date?  Note that this check assumes the software that generates the SGX image maintains a proper SVN process.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>IETF RATS (Remote Attestation Procedures) defines a suite of protocols that enable attesters (devices/applications) to
perform an attestation exchange with a RATS Verifier (a Trust Broker) and receive an attestation result/verdict in a RATS compliant format. In this revision of the document, the RATS
Passport based topology is followed and the received attestation verdict (known as the Passport)
is encoded as a C2PA attestation assertion, which is then embedded in a Manifest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The remainder of the sub-sections describe how the desired attestation can be obtained and interpreted
from a device complying with the ARM Platform Security Architecture (PSA) which supports the
IETF RATS based attestation protocol. Additional architectures will be defined in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Attestation Evidence is a set of signed platform-specific claims that is generated from
the ARM PSA device.  The Attestation Evidence is a specific profile of an Entity Attestation Token (EAT)
documented <a href="https://thomas-fossati.github.io/draft-psa-token/draft-tschofenig-rats-psa-token.html">here</a>.
The RATS trust broker which performs the Attestation Verification and provides the Attestation Verdict is built
on  Open Source componentry called <a href="https://github.com/veraison">Veraison</a></p>

<h4 id="_obtaining_an_attestation_3"><a class="anchor" href="#_obtaining_an_attestation_3"></a>A.4.1. Obtaining an Attestation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ARM PSA Attestation Architecture API is documented
<a href="https://arm-software.github.io/psa-api/attestation/1.0/IHI0085-PSA_Certified_Attestation_API-1.0.3.pdf">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to comply with C2PA requirement of binding user-supplied data
(the hash of the to-be-signed Partial Claim) to the platform attestation AND
ease of integration of the ARM PSA attestation with the C2PA claim signing application, a simple
binding layer enhancement to the base PSA Implementation on the device is used.  This enhancement is
documented <a href="https://github.com/veraison/docs/blob/psa-extensions/musings/psa-extension.md">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this enhancement in place, the following sequence should be used to create the attestation:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The C2PA Claim-Signer Application invokes the binding layer API
<code>uint8_t  request_attestation(uint8_t* data_ptr, uint8_t data_size, uint8_t* result_data_ptr, uint8_t* result_size)</code>. Here <code>data_ptr</code> points to the hash of <code>attestation-tbs-map</code> and <code>data_size</code> is the
size of the hash, in bytes. The remaining arguments are return values that are set if the function call completes successfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon receipt of the call, an attestation protocol handshake is performed between the binding layer
and the <a href="https://github.com/veraison">Veraison</a> RATS Trust Broker Service.
The exact message exchange follows the RATS Challenge-Response Protocol, which is described
<a href="https://github.com/veraison/docs/tree/main/api/challenge-response">here</a>.  The high level flow of RATS Verification steps performed by a RATS Trust Broker Service can be found
<a href="https://ietf-rats-wg.github.io/draft-ietf-rats-corim/draft-ietf-rats-corim.html#name-corim-based-appraisal-of-ev">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the attestation protocol completes successfully, the function returns <code>0</code> and the <code>result_data_ptr</code> receives the attestation verdict encoded as a signed Jason Web Token (JWT) or CBOR Web Token (CWT) object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of JWT, <code>attestation-results</code> in <code>attestation-info-map</code> is set to the UTF-8-encoded JWT, as described in <a href="#attestation-assertion-definition">Section 7.6.1.3</a>.
In the case of CWT, <code>attestation-results</code> in <code>attestation-info-map</code> is set to the CBOR-encoded token without further encoding.
The media type of the <code>attestation-results</code> payload is used to deduce the encoding. For example, a JWT serialization would use:
<code>application/eat-jwt; eat_profile="tag:github.com,2023:veraison/ear"</code> and CWT would use <code>application/eat-cwt; eat_profile="tag:github.com,2023:veraison/ear"</code></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A RATS Attestation Result is based on the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fv-rats-ear/">EAT Attestation Result</a>
format serialized as a JWT or CWT. The semantic core is defined by the
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fv-rats-ear/">AR4SI trustworthiness vector</a>
i.e. a collection of well-defined appraisal categories that uses a standardized "scoring" system to present a
normalized, yet rich view of the appraised attester. The basic purpose of the trustworthiness vector is to decouple
a broad range of attesters/devices from the Relying Parties so that the latter can take a fine-grained policy decisions
without having any specific knowledge about the device they are interacting with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attestation-aware C2PA Validator shall perform the following steps for attestation verification.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Extract the Attestation Assertion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract the <code>att-result</code> field to obtain the CWT or JWT, then verify the signature using the
public key of the Verifier. The Verifier public key can be either pre-fetched from the Verifier
or obtained at the time of Verification using the defined public interface,
<a href="https://github.com/veraison/docs/tree/main/api/well-known">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon signature verification, decode the CWT or JWT, for example, using the EAT Attestation Result(EAR) Library
<a href="https://github.com/veraison/c-ear">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the decoded content, extract the <code>user data</code> from the EAR Veraison specific extension</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute the hash of the Partial Claim and match it with <code>user data</code> claim from the EAR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decode the <code>att-result</code> to get the structure of the Attestation Results as
given in <a href="https://github.com/veraison/ear/tree/main/">EAT Attestation Result</a> or using
equivalent "C" based decoder <a href="https://github.com/veraison/c-ear">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decode the Appraisal structure to obtain the <code>Trustworthiness Vector</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ascertain that the Status value is <code>TrustTierAffirming</code>.
A Verifier which receives Status value as <code>TrustTierContraindicated</code> can conclude
that the underlying platform is not trustworthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the Hardware and Executables trustworthiness claim are set to
<code>TrustTierAffirming</code>. This is an indicator of a genuine hardware running a

For example, if a claim included two standard assertions and one Attestation Assertion, then the Partial Claim will contain an <code>assertions</code> array containing two elements. If a Partial Claim contains two standard assertions and two Attestation Assertions, then two Partial Claims are defined: one omitting just the last Attestation Assertion in the <code>attestations</code> array, and one omitting both Attestation Assertions.  Of course, the order of the Attestation Assertions must be preserved as the Partial Claim is created and validated.
