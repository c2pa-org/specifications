<div class="paragraph">
<p>The C2PA builds security into our designs as they are being developed, but also expects that security design and threat modelling will continue as the system, ecosystem, and threat landscape evolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this end, the C2PA uses a focused threat modelling process to support development of a strong security and privacy design. Outcomes of the effort directly support development of documentation about explicit threats and security considerations while also facilitating security-oriented thinking throughout the design process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The threat modelling process combines synchronous (i.e., live) threat modelling sessions with focused groups of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in the asynchronous development of content.  The number of attendees in each synchronous session is kept small to promote efficient discussions, but all members of the C2PA have the opportunity to participate via either modality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like other security activities, we expect our threat modelling process to evolve with the C2PA ecosystem. Process documentation is considered a guide rather than a strict directive on how threat modelling works within the C2PA.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basis of making trust decisions in C2PA, its <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_model" class="xref page">Trust Model</a>, is the identity of the claim generator associated with the cryptographic signing key used to sign the claim in the active manifest. The certificate for the claim generator is provided by a certificate authority (CA) that supports C2PA signing from the C2PA <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_lists" class="xref page">Trust List</a>. The C2PA maintains a Trust List of approved C2PA certificate authorities that all C2PA validators must recognize. This Trust List can be extended with additional certificate authorities for customized implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA leverages trusted time-stamps to ensure the correctness of signing and revocation processes. A benefit of this approach is that revocation status can be optionally obtained when claims are generated (rather than when consumed), and revocation can be applied to subsets of signatures by time-stamp. See the <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_lists" class="xref page">Trust Model section of the specification</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA Manifests can be validated indefinitely regardless of whether the cryptographic credentials used to sign its contents are later expired or revoked.</p>

<td class="content">
In version 2.0 of the C2PA specification, there were several significant changes to the Trust Model. The term <a href="#2.0@specs:C2PA_Specification.html#_2_0_january_2024" class="xref unresolved">actor</a> was reduced to no longer refer to humans or organizations. The C2PA specification now focuses on claim generators and claim signers. The C2PA specification continues to support the addition of identity assertions which could include a human actor, a pseudonym, completely anonymous, or pertain to a service or trusted hardware device with its own identity, including an application running inside such a service or trusted hardware. However, the C2PA specification no longer defines how identity must be expressed within an identity assertion. The security and validity of the information present within the identity assertion will be dependent on which identity specification was chosen by the creator of the identity assertion.

<p>Manifests are signed with a digital signature to maintain the integrity of the data.

The content consumer will need to determine whether a certificate, and the associated certificate chain, is a trusted source.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To assist the content consumer, the validator is required to maintain a list of trust anchors to facilitate validation of the certificate chain. While the validator will trust the trust anchors in their list, a content consumer may need the ability to apply a additional criteria for trust for a given situation. Therefore, the content consumer will need to be able to view the trust anchors for the content. A validator may also allow the user to create and maintain a <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_signer_credential_trust" class="xref page">private credential store</a> of signing credentials for each credential type. This store is intended as an "address book" of credentials they have chosen to trust based on an out-of-band relationship.</p>

<p>Some validators may be purpose-built for validating content from a finite set of sources who use a finite set of trust anchors.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following assumptions are made about entities that may attack C2PA technology:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attackers have full access to public assets and associated public metadata, including C2PA Manifests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attackers may attempt to access claim generator software (e.g., C2PA-enabled photo editing software) as a typical user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attackers do not have access to private keys referenced within the C2PA ecosystem (e.g., claim signing private keys, Time-stamping Authority private keys, etc.). They may, however, attempt to access these keys via exploitation techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attackers have the ability to publish assets to an impactful audience, for example, as a social media user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantum computing cryptanalytic attacks are considered out-of-scope.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following additional assumptions are made about the threat model:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacks that rely on bypassing conventional security models of non-C2PA technology are considered out-of-scope. For example:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacks against the C2PA validator as an architectural component within a user agent (e.g., web browser) are considered in-scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A compromise of the C2PA validation logic via some non-C2PA attack vector within the user agent is considered out-of-scope, since this would typically require bypassing the security model of the user agent (e.g. escaping a web browser sandbox or compromising the host via other means).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacks across conventional trust boundaries are considered in-scope.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_hardware_layer"><a class="anchor" href="#_hardware_layer"></a>4.2.2.1. Hardware layer:</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attacks against hardware implementations of C2PA would attempt to leverage the trust of the hardware manufacturer.
For example, a camera lens sends digital information to the camera’s CPU to sign what was captured. A hardware attacker might inject their own data between the lens and the camera’s CPU to convince the camera to sign fake images.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_cryptographic_pki"><a class="anchor" href="#_cryptographic_pki"></a>4.2.2.2. Cryptographic PKI</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attacks against a PKI infrastructure might leverage several techniques. A simple example of this attack would be creating a self-signed certificate that spoofs a legitimate certificate in an attempt to exploit a flaw in the validator&#8217;s implementation of trust list verification. Another example attack would be to socially engineer a certificate authority to sign content with another user’s credentials. These attacks could also include attacking the cryptographic algorithms used in the signature. Lastly, the attacker could attempt to steal a signing key either through compromising a signing service, compromising a user’s credentials to the signing service, or stealing the hardware used by the image creator. In addition to the guidance described below for specific threats, further cryptography recommendations are provided in the Trust section of the <a href="../../1.4/guidance/Guidance.html#_trust" class="xref page">Guidance for Implementers</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_user_interface"><a class="anchor" href="#_user_interface"></a>4.2.2.3. User interface</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attackers targeting the user interface would create malicious manifest data that targets the user interface in which the user views the rendered content credentials. In this scenario, the attackers would embed malicious data into the C2PA metadata. When an end-user uses a user interface to view the C2PA metadata, the malicious data would be extraced from the asset and presented to the end user. This data could attempt to confuse the end-user directly. For instance, the attacker might try to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">homoglyph attacks</a> to confuse the end-user regarding the text that they are reading. Alternatively, the attacker might attempt to inject malicious data that could take control of the user interface and interfere with what is presented to the end-user. As an example, a flaw in a web-based user interface might allow the malicious manifest data to be interpreted as code by the web browser which would result in cross-site scripting. If the attacker&#8217;s malicious payload is interpeted as JavaScript by the web browser, then the attacker could manipulate the trusted user interface into presenting false information to the end-user.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_consumers"><a class="anchor" href="#_consumers"></a>4.2.2.4. Consumers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consumer attacks would focus on victimizing the human users of C2PA implementations. For instance, they might leverage how the C2PA specification allows remote manifests and references to other remote data to track and identify viewers of the content. When a person views Content Credentials, their client may make requests to these resources. If the remote resources are hosted by the attacker, the attacker could track which IP addresses have viewed specific assets. In countries where viewing certain types of content is prosecuted, this could result in the viewer’s life being put at risk. In addition, it may be possible to frame someone for viewing banned content. An attacker could take a safe image and embed a banned image containing remote C2PA metadata as an ingredient. While the user would only see the safe image, they would be flagged for looking at banned content when the manifests for the embedded ingredient are resolved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_c2pa_implementations"><a class="anchor" href="#_c2pa_implementations"></a>4.2.2.5. C2PA implementations</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These attacks would focus on exploiting the software or hardware involved in C2PA Manifest processing. An example of this type of attack would be generating a C2PA Manifest with a sufficiently large payload to perform a buffer overflow. An attacker might also include malicious manifests that result in an image being misclassified by implementations that correlates C2PA information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_c2pa_specification"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_c2pa_specification"></a>4.2.2.6. The C2PA specification</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These attackers would have a thorough understanding in the C2PA specification and look for potential flaws in the C2PA guidance. While every effort is made to ensure that C2PA guidance is secure, a threat model would not be complete without taking into account the possibility for a mistake in the guidance or a change in the threat landscape that undermines the core tenets of the specification. Similar specifications have improved with each new version as a result of issues identified in the previous version. The threat model must take into account the possibility that the C2PA specification will have an unforeseen issue requiring an update to the specification and potential action by the C2PA community.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_community_trust"><a class="anchor" href="#_community_trust"></a>4.2.2.7. Community trust</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One method for attacking the specification is to undermine people’s trust in the technology. For instance, frequent attacks spoofing information from C2PA Manifests, while not the direct fault of the specification, could wear on the community’s patience and trust of the technology. If these attacks result in frequent efforts on the part of the end-user to verify that the content is not a spoofing attack, then they will lose patience from the extra required effort and abandon the technology. Once the community abandons the technology, attackers can revert to their original techniques for creating disinformation. The community needs be aware of malicious disruptors in the community and work to minimize their impact.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_misrepresentation_and_assumptions"><a class="anchor" href="#_misrepresentation_and_assumptions"></a>4.2.2.8. Misrepresentation and assumptions</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These types of attacks are focused on human assumptions rather than technical attacks. For instance, one attack might be to take a photo of an image rendered by a high-definition television. The image captured by the device would be technically valid and realistic. However, without proper contextual information, a viewer of the image would assume that it was taken of a real event rather than a manufactured TV image. Similarly, there are also techniques for creating optical illusions for cameras. In these instances, the capture device correctly records and signs what came through the camera lens. However, the resulting image leads the viewer to a false conclusion about the event.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attacker misuses a legitimate claim generator (e.g., photo editing service) to add misleading provenance to a C2PA-enabled asset.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ability to access and exploit or misuse a claim generator system.

<p>An attacker may be able to misuse or exploit a claim signing system to create malicious C2PA Manifests that can then be delivered to targeted users/systems. For instance, assume that a camera manufacturer creates C2PA manifests for photos taken with their cameras. The goal of the camera&#8217;s implementation is only to support assertions related to the camera hardware and information collected by the camera at the time of capture. The camera manufacturer does not support adding any other assertions to their claims. An attacker may try to inject their own assertions into the camera&#8217;s claim signing process to make it appear as though their malicious assertions also originated from the camera manufacturer. For instance, if the camera manufacturer did not support identity-related assertions, then the attacker might try to inject an identity assertion with the hopes that consumers of the image would assume that the camera manufacturer validated that identity. The list of possible assertions that would be useful for an attacker to attempt to inject would be contextual to the specific service or device.</p>

It is also highly recommended that all signing credentials include revocation information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever technically possible, the claim signing service should validate that the request originated from a trusted source. In addition, claim generators should add data validation logic that confirms that the supplied data does not include any unexpected or unsupported assertions.

<p>A claim signing service can optionally consider checking the values within the assertions when data validation is possible.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each manifest has a digital signature that includes a hash of the original content. An assertion is redacted by using zeroes to overwrite the relevant section of the manifest. However, the original hash remains a part of the image via the signature. The redaction information includes information on the type of data that was redacted from the original manifest. An attacker may try to guess what was originally contained within the assertion by brute-forcing the potential values until they find a value that matches the original hash. While many bytes will have been replaced with zeroes, the standardization of the formatting means that many of those bytes will be predictable. In addition, brute forcing of all possible values may not be necessary for certain situations. For instance, an attacker may just want to confirm whether the image was created using a short list of individuals that they are interested in. Therefore, they would only need to test whether author assertions with those values match the hash. Some data types, such as geolocation, have a finite set of overall values and even smaller set of likely values if you can make certain assumptions about where the photo might have been taken.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong>
For some workflows, a claim generator will have assertions that it creates within its own trusted environment, referred to as "created assertions." The claim generator may also accept assertions from clients outside of its environment, called "gathered assertions." An attacker may try to cause parsing errors or confusion in parsers by injecting gathered assertions that overlap with the created assertions. As an example, an untrusted client might try to send their own "claim_generator" assertion with the intent that their gathered assertion value will override the created assertion value from the claim generator within a UI. An attacker may also try to confuse the claim generator parser by sending created assertion types within their gathered assertions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
The attacker must be able to send customized assertions to a claim generator. The claim generator needs to have a flaw where created assertions and gathered assertions are not properly separated. Alternatively, a Content Credentials UI must have a flaw where the gathered assertion values override the created assertion values or appear to have precdent over the created assertions values.</p>

<p><strong>Security guidance</strong>
Claim generators should ensure that gathered assertions can never be inserted into the map of created assertions. Claim generators may choose to have a deny list blocking claim signing requests where it is clear that an attacker is sending assertions that conflict with their created assertions in order to prevent abuse within their environments. C2PA UI implementations should clearly seperate gathered assertions from created assertions within the UI so that end-users can distinguish between the two sources.</p>

Lastly, the attacker could try visual attacks where an image within the asset, such as a thumbnail or icon, is designed to confuse the end-user. For instance, the image could contain text such as, "Verified by &#8230;&#8203;" or a lock icon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The attacker needs to have access to a claim signing mechanism that will allow for arbitrary text within signed claims. This could be a self-signing mechanism if the targeted implementation does not limit content based on the certificate authority.</p>

<p>The viewer of the claim metadata will be misled with regards to the validity of the image.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Security guidance</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prior to claim signing, signers can verify that the fields provided contain the expected characters, length, and format for the given field. When displaying Content Credentials, implementations can leverage output encoding to prevent special characters from being interpreted as code. In addition, attacker controlled data should be displayed in text fields that do support code execution and that can correctly handle data of unexpected lengths. For web applications, a Content Security Policy (CSP) can help mitigate certain types of attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, one of the potential vectors for this class of attack would an SVG file that contains malicious JavaScript. The C2PA specification currently supports SVG images as the primary asset or ingredient. In additon, the C2PA specification supports SVG files as the icon within the <code>generator-info-map</code>. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious when rendering SVG files either directly or as part of supporting claim generator icons. Implementations should apply best practices to prevent the execution of JavaScript such as ensuring that the image is loaded from a separate domain from the UI, loading the file through the use of HTML <code>img</code> tags, and applying a Content Security Policy to prevent the execution of JavaScript within the SVG image.</p>

An attacker can try to position themselves between two nodes on a network, such as a desktop application and a server.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Description</strong>
Some organizations may choose to sign all images on their website. This may cause issues if images such as 1x1 tracking pixels or image-not-found icons are signed. An attacker may try to mislead the viewer by using those images as ingredients of a malicious image. Assume that an attacker wants end-users to believe that their malicious image is only a slight modification of a trusted image from the organization. When the human consumer looks at the provenance history in a UI, they will see the attacker&#8217;s image and the provenance will chain down to the organization&#8217;s image. The human consumer may not be able to see a 1x1 pixel in the UI. If the organization&#8217;s signed image was an image-not-found icon, then the human viewer would see a broken image icon. In either case, the consumer may assume that the provenance UI is having issues, and that the organization&#8217;s original image is not rendering correctly.

Some end-users will be confused as to the origin of the attacker&#8217;s image resulting in their assumption that is the same, or nearly the same, as the organization&#8217;s image.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core provenance mechanism in C2PA is that of the claim signature, where a private key associated with a certificate signs the contents of the claim within a manifest. In situations where a human is using a claim generator to sign a creation or modification activity on some digital content, it is possible that the claim generator signs with a certificate that is unique or rare within the overall C2PA ecosystem. Where the instance of that certificate or key used for signing is reasonably rare, malicious actors may be able to use that certificate as a method to uniquely identify the human along with correlating data, or at least the device itself. This can be a serious issue for individuals who need to maintain their anonymity for safety reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This attack could occur in two possible directions. The first is the attacker using a collection of images created by the claim generator&#8217;s certificate, and cross-referencing the data to narrow down the list of possible humans who could have created those images.

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use single-use certificates in combination with environments that provide cryptographically strong protection for the storage and deletion of the certificate after it is used.</p>

A risk may also exist if the certificate can be associated with an organization in scenarios where being identified as a member of that organization could put anyone within the group at risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a claim has been signed by a certificate that could put an individual or group at risk, then one option is to remove the manifest containing that claim signature. The information from the removed manifest can be transferred to a new claim signed by a claim signing certificate that would not put the party at risk. For instance, an at-risk journalist could have their manifest removed from an asset and the parent news organization could create a new claim using their claim generator with the same information. If the information putting the individual at risk is a single assertion and not the claim signature itself, then it is possible to redact individual assertions instead of the entire manifest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At-risk individuals should be aware of what their claim generator logs with regards to signing actions and whether those logs would be accessible to the party putting them at risk.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A revocation of a key can be triggered by many types of events. For simplicity, this document will discuss three common scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><em>Early planned retirement of a trusted key.</em>
This can occur when an organization wants to change a property of an existing certificate by switching to a new certificate that meets the new requirements. For instance, an organization may want to upgrade the cryptographic algorithms used to secure their certifcate or change the values in the certificate&#8217;s subject fields. Another scenario where early revocation might occur is as part of an end-of-life (EOL) process for infrastructure that is no longer supported. By revoking certificates that are no longer in use, an organization can reduce the risks of an attacker gaining access to old key material. This is an optional step taken by some organizations to help ensure that their key material is not used after it is no longer needed. Depending on the design of the PKI heirarchy in use by the organization, this process could potentially involve the revocation of intermediate certificates in addition to leaf certificates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attackers gain access to the key material.</em>
Another scenario is that malicious actors are able to gain access to the key which invalidates the key’s integrity. The attacker&#8217;s access can either be direct or indirect. Direct access is when the attackers are able to extract a copy of the private key. Indirect access occurs when the attackers gain access to systems that are permitted to send signing requests to a hardware security module (HSM). Access to these systems allow the attackers to sign their own content with the organization’s code signing key. When either of these attacks occur, the organization must revoke their key to protect the integrity of their organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The certificate authority (CA) is compromised.</em>
This is the least common scenario. However, it is possible that the organization&#8217;s certificate authority becomes compromised and an intermediary certificate needs to be revoked. This can occur when a third-party certificate authority is breached. If the organization has its own intermediary certificate, then this event could happen if a data breach of the organization affects the intermediate certificate. Depending on the CA, revocations may be issued for all leaf certificates affected by the breach in addition to revocation of the intermediate certificate. While these events are rare, they are still a possibility that organizations should have a plan to address since it could result in the revocation of a large amount of content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A revocation is a request made to the Certificate Authority (CA) to end the validity of the certificate prior to the certificate’s original expiration date. When the request is made as part of a normal operational process, such as the first scenario, the revocation is effective as of the date when the CA adds the certificate to its revocation list. This ensures that all content signed prior to the revocation date is still valid and trusted. Any attempts to sign content after the revocation date will result in untrusted content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the revocation is made due to a breach that compromises the key&#8217;s integrity, then there will be two dates involved in the revocation. The first date will be when the revocation information was created by the certificate authority. The second date will be the date when the organization believes that the key first became compromised. The second date is necessary because it typically takes an organization time to detect and report the breach. It must be assumed that the attackers were actively using the key during that time window. In this scenario, all content signed by the certificate after the key became compromised becomes untrusted. This ensures that any content signed between when the key became compromised and when it was reported to the CA is also considered to be untrusted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, let’s say that an organization is breached on February 1st. However, it takes the organization a month to detect the breach, recover their systems, and issue the revocation. Therefore, the revocation is created on March 1st and the date of the initial compromise for the key is considered to be February 1st. All content that was signed between February 1st and March 1st will be considered untrusted, regardless of whether it was created by the attackers or the key&#8217;s owner. In addition, any content signed with that certificate after March 1st will also be considered untrusted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes an organization will choose not to time-stamp the content that they sign. A certificate revocation will result in any content signed without a time-stamp to be revoked. Since the revocation algorithm will not be able to determine whether or not the content was signed before or after the revocation, it will default to considering the content as untrusted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pre_planning"><a class="anchor" href="#_pre_planning"></a>5.2. Pre-planning</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step in revocation planning starts before a key is even created. This includes plans for how many keys will be necessary, their scope and usage, their protection, and operational policies. A good key management plan can help minimize the impact of any unplanned need for key revocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong>
It is highly recommended that keys be stored in a Hardware Security Module (HSM). These devices can ensure that a private key, either uploaded or created by the system, can never be extracted from the system with the proper settings. This is true even for the HSM owner. HSMs provide several layers of protections. An attacker will never be able to steal a direct copy of the private key. Access to the key is controlled via authentication and authorization. In addition, all signing requests are logged which can allow a forensics team to determine when an attacker made requests to HSM system and the hashes of any binaries that were signed as a result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scope of usage:</strong>
Organizations that sign high volumes of content should split the signing of content across multiple keys, For instance, if an organization chooses to use a single key for all their signing needs, this creates the possibility that a revocation of that key due to a security breach will result in a large amount of content being revoked. As an example, assume that a system signs 1,000 images per day. An attacker compromises a key on the first of the month. It takes the company 7 days to detect the breach, clean up the environment, and rotate to a new key. During that time, in addition to the content that the attacker created, the 7,000 valid images created during that window would also be revoked. It is not possible to revoke individual pieces of content based on the hashes of the binaries that the attackers created with the HSMs. If the signing needs of an organization were instead split across multiple keys, then a revocation of any one of those keys would have a much smaller impact than the single key approach. If an organization has more than one claim generator, then the organization should have a different certificate for each claim generator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifetime of the certificate:</strong>
Short-lived certificates that are only valid for days, hours, or minutes can help reduce the possibility of a valid certificate being stolen. For instance, some organizations may choose to generate short-lived certificates in higher risk scenarios. A client would indicate that they have content that is ready to sign, the claim generator would perform an authentication and authorization check to confirm that the client is allowed to use the service, and then the claim generating service would create a short-lived certificate for that signature or a defined time window for multiple signatures. These approaches often help to reduce the windows of opportunity that a malicious third-party has to successfully gain access to a valid certificate and key.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is important to note that this approach does not guarantee that the volume of content that an adversary can sign with a stolen key will be small. If an advanced adversary has planned ahead and already pre-generated the content that they want to sign with the stolen key, then the adversary can likely sign all of that content within the window of time that the key is valid. In this scenario, a revocation could apply to a large amount of malicious content but it would only affect a small number of valid users since the certificate was generated for a specific purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Short-lived certificates are a best practice in scenarios where signing requests are infrequent since certificates are only generated as needed and have no value outside of those short time windows. Short-lived certicates can also be at a technique to limit the number of impacted users when a revocation needs to occur because the certificate was generated for a specific set of content. However, short-lived certificates may not be practical for all scenarios since the overhead of generating and protecting the certificates at scale may be too high in some situations.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time-stamps:</strong>
By applying time-stamps to signed content, it is possible to ensure that any content created prior to the breach remains trusted. If a revocation occurs and the content does not have a time-stamp for comparison against the revocation date, then the content will be assumed to be untrusted. Time-stamps also allow customers to have a secondary method to confirm whether their content will be affected in the event that a revocation deployment takes time to roll out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OCSP Stapling:</strong>
Revocation checking behavior may depend on choices made during the content signing process. All C2PA content signers should ensure that their systems are not using revoked or expired certificates as described in <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#x509_certificates" class="xref page">14.6.2</a>. The OCSP response from that verification can be attached to the image using OCSP stapling techniques. This technique, along with time-stamps, will allow a downstream validator to confirm that the certificate was not revoked at the time the content was signed. This pre-check can be useful in streamlining downstream validation processes and assisting when the OCSP server is unavailable. For content that may be sensitive to view, this technique can also help reduce unnecessary network calls when viewing the content.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, OCSP stapling can have drawbacks since it is possible that the signing process occurred after the key&#8217;s compromise date but before the compromise was detected. Once the revocation is issued by the CA, the signed content would be considered to be revoked if a query is made to the OCSP server. However, the revocation check for that content may not occur until the OCSP response stapled to the content expires.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OCSP stapling is optional within the C2PA specification, and organizations should balance the benefits and risks associated with OCSP stapling. If OCSP stapling is used, then organizations should also be careful when choosing the length of the validity period for the stapled response in order to balance the risks associated with a potentially delayed revocation check.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-existing information stores</strong>
Any revocation plan should take into account places where the image or the C2PA metadata may be stored or cached. For instance, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) may have caches of the images that persist and need to be cleared. In addition, an image&#8217;s watermark or digital fingerprint may have been stored by online services along with the original C2PA metadata. When a search is conducted via these online services, the original C2PA metadata with the revoked certificate may be returned. Planning for a revocation includes planning for how to handle situations when customers encounter older versions of the image based on the revoked certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policies and plans:</strong>
It is important to have documentation ahead of time for how to handle a revocation. Contact your certificate authority to understand their procedures and point of contact for a revocation. Revoking certificates once they are no longer planned to be used is a healthy practice that eliminates the risk of attackers being able to use those keys before their expiration date.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For revocations associated with a data breach, it is likely that some valid content will get labeled as untrusted due to a revocation. Therefore, have a plan in place for how to rotate the keys and have a plan for any content that will need to be quickly re-signed by the new, valid certificate. Depending on the usage of the key and the window between compromise and revocation, this may be a process that needs to work at scale. In addition, content may need to replaced where it has been deployed. The ability to act quickly is necessary to minimize the impact for the organization and users.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communications plans:</strong>
A communication plan is one type of policy and plan related to the above suggestions. However, this plan is being called out separately because the situation may be complicated. A revocation can cause confusion for content consumers who may not understand the errors that they are seeing. In addition, the content consumers may be consuming the content on a site that isn&#8217;t controlled by the entity whose certificate is revoked. It is also important to note that multiple audiences may need to be notified and provided messaging appropriate to their relationship with revoked certificates.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Revocation in complex content workflows may also be confusing for content consumers. As an example, assume that the certificate that needs to be revoked was used in the middle of a processing chain. For this example, assume that the content processing chain is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A) An image was created and signed by a camera.<br>
B) The organization’s tool was used to apply some edits to the photo.<br>
C) Another tool was used to apply contextual labeling to the photo.<br>
D) A fourth tool is used to apply some final production edits prior to publishing.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final image from this workflow has manifests from all four steps in that process. When the certificate associated with step B is revoked, it affects all of organizations involved in steps C and D. If a content consumer looks at the manifest history, then it will show A is valid, B is revoked, C is valid, and D is valid. This will likely result in confusion for consumers of the content and the other organizations involved. Therefore, a robust communication plan will need to be in place. The communication plan should cover all potentially involved parties since each party may need different information. For instance, a communications plan may need to cover messaging to employees, customers, law enforcement, business partners and other key stakeholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, a communication plan should be familiar with the user experience that a content consumer will see when viewing content with a revoked certificate. While each C2PA implementation will have variations in the overall user experience, the C2PA User Experience Guidance documentation establishes a baseline model for consistency in the usage of icons and messages. A revoked certificate would be addressed by the <a href="#2.0@ux:UX_Recommendations.adocl#_invalid_states" class="xref unresolved">invalid states</a> section of that document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For deployments using OCSP stapling, be prepared for questions regarding why some content may still appear to be valid after the revocation has been posted. The content may continue to appear valid until the OCSP stapling validity period expires. In addition, older versions of the C2PA metadata may have been stored in systems that track images based on digital fingerprints, watermarks, and C2PA metadata. Customers may come across the original C2PA metadata when searching these systems with the new image.</p>

<h3 id="_revoking_a_certificate"><a class="anchor" href="#_revoking_a_certificate"></a>5.3. Revoking a certificate</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All C2PA participants whose keys become compromised shall promptly issue a revocation request to their certificate authority. The disclosure to the CA shall include the reason for the revocation and the date that the key was considered compromised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When re-signing valid C2PA content with the new certificate, there are a few different situations that may occur.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> There is a single manifest and the content was only signed by the organization for use by the same organization. Any downstream edits of the content were not approved or allowed by the organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this scenario, the organization can strip the previous manifest and re-sign with a new manifest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> There are multiple manifests, and the revoked certificate was used in an intermediary step in the process. As an example, we can use the structure previously mentioned in the communications plan:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A) An image was created and signed by the camera.<br>
B) The organization’s tool was used to apply some edits to the photo.<br>
C) Another tool was used to apply news organization labeling to the photo.<br>
D) A fourth tool is used to apply some final production edits prior to publishing.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this scenario, assume that the certificate associated with phase B is revoked. The organization has two options:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Revert back to the version of the asset associated with the last valid manifest before the revoked manifest, and then restart the process from that point. This may or may not be technically possible depending on the changes that have occurred with the asset since that phase. In addition, this approach will depend on how important maintaining the original time-stamps are for the provenance of the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the content unchanged. Leverage your communications plan to inform consumers of the situation and how best to handle the revoked content. This approach would require a method for consumers to easily find your communications in the event that pro-active messaging directly to the consumers is possible.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Customers should have a clear understanding about how C2PA implementations function and their supported use cases. The C2PA specification can support a wide range of use cases ranging from anonymous journalism to basic attribution for creative artists. More complex use cases may require additional protections outside the scope of this specification. C2PA implementors should be transparent with customers about the use cases that they intend to support.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One potential use case for C2PA is anonymous journalists who are at risk of physical harm if they are caught. Supporting this use case would involve protections outside of what is detailed in the C2PA specification such as legal response plans and specialized logging. If the solution is not designed to support the anonymous journalist use case, then those types of users should be able to easily discern that the solution is not appropriate for their needs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Customers will need to know how to control the generation of C2PA metadata in their content. Accidental or unintentional inclusion of metadata could cause harm to at risk groups. For instance, children are often a specialized use case due to additional legal protections and potential threats. In addition, there may be abuse victims who need to control their ability to be tracked by those who could cause them harm. Providing transparency about how to disable C2PA tracking can help protect these users.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remote C2PA content credential references could be used to track viewers of a piece of content against their will. A malicious author might intentionally use remote references to track anyone who views the image to identify their perceived enemy. One protection option is to warn the user that the content has remote credentials and obtain confirmation as to whether they want that information retrieved. If consent is granted, consider proxying the fetching of that information for the end-user. This action would prevent the end-user’s IP address from being disclosed to the remote site. Regardless of implementation, it is encouraged to inform content consumers how data will be fetched. No data should ever be fetched over an insecure channel.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Content authors may need to be able to support multiple profiles for different use cases. Freelance artists and journalists may work for more than one employer and may need to split their identities to reflect their different employment situations. People may also want to split their professional and personal identities. Lastly, certain types of artists may want to publish using a pseudonym, such as a nom de plume or stage name.  Therefore, provide clarity to end-users about how to best control their identities and the identity of their devices.</p>

<h3 id="_incident_response"><a class="anchor" href="#_incident_response"></a>6.2. Incident response</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is likely that highly skilled and highly resourced adversaries will be targeting C2PA infrastructure. Therefore, C2PA implementations should have incident response plans for when they are targeted. Incident response plans should be prepared for all aspects of the C2PA implementation and ecosystem. A breach could occur in the implementation’s software or hosting environment. There could be a breach of an end-user, such as an account compromise. In addition, there could be a breach of C2PA dependency, such as a certificate authority. Practice executing the incident response plans on a regular basis to ensure that any attack can be quickly mitigated with minimal system impact.</p>
