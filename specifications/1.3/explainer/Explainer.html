<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The development of this Explainer is ongoing. This Explainer accompanies the C2PA Specifications with the intent of providing further background and clarification on the development of the standard, its goals, mechanisms and guidelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Explainer is not a technical document and is directed towards the general public.</p>

<h2 id="_goals_and_non_goals"><a class="anchor" href="#_goals_and_non_goals"></a>2. Goals and Non-goals</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of the C2PA specifications is to tackle the extraordinary challenge of trusting media in a context of rapidly evolving technology and the democratization of powerful creation and editing techniques. To this end, the specifications are designed to enable global, opt-in, adoption of digital provenance techniques through the creation of a rich ecosystem of digital provenance enabled applications for a wide range of individuals and organizations while meeting appropriate security and privacy requirements, as well as human rights considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to highlight that C2PA specifications do not provide value judgments about whether a given set of provenance data is 'true', but instead merely whether the provenance information can be verified as associated with the underlying asset, correctly formed, and free from tampering.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Provenance generally refers to the facts about the history of a piece of digital content assets (image, video, audio recording, document). C2PA enables the authors of provenance data to securely bind statements of provenance data to instances of content using their unique credentials. These provenance statements are called assertions by the C2PA. They may include assertions about who created the content and how, when, and where it was created. They may also include assertions about when and how it was edited throughout its life. The content author, and publisher (if authoring provenance data) always has control over whether to include provenance data as well as what assertions are included, such as whether to include identifying information (in order to allow for anonymous or pseudonymous assets). Included assertions can be removed in later edits without invalidating or removing all of the included provenance data in a process called <a href="#_what_is_redaction_and_how_does_it_work">redaction</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_does_it_mean_that_provenance_data_is_cryptographically_bound_to_the_asset"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_does_it_mean_that_provenance_data_is_cryptographically_bound_to_the_asset"></a>3.1.2. What does it mean that provenance data is cryptographically bound to the asset?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The provenance data and the asset are the two parts of the same puzzle - a unique puzzle. The possibility of any other pieces ever matching, either by coincidence or by a purposeful attempt to generate a match, is so low that it would be practically impossible. In other words, any alteration to either the asset or the provenance, however insignificant, would alter the mathematical algorithm - the shape of the piece of the puzzle - in such a way that they would no longer match.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We refer to this as a hard binding. For more technical information on this see "hard binding" in the <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_glossary" class="xref page">glossary</a> and the <a href="../guidance/Guidance.html" class="xref page">non-normative guidance</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_can_c2pa_help_with_assets_created_from_multiple_sources"><a class="anchor" href="#_can_c2pa_help_with_assets_created_from_multiple_sources"></a>3.1.3. Can C2PA help with assets created from multiple sources?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When one asset is created from a series of other assets, those sources are referred to as the <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_ingredient" class="xref page">ingredients</a>. Each ingredient that is used in the (composed) asset is recorded in that asset&#8217;s provenance, including the addition of the provenance of each individual ingredient. This process creates a chain of provenance that can stretch all the way back to each ingredient&#8217;s creation.</p>

<h4 id="_what_is_redaction_and_how_does_it_work"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_is_redaction_and_how_does_it_work"></a>3.1.4. What is redaction and how does it work?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Redaction is the process of permanently removing information. In the world of C2PA it specifically refers to removing assertions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if a human rights organization wishes to remove assertions about the photographer from an image, it can do so via the redaction process. The act of redaction (and the optional inclusion of a reason for that redaction) becomes part of the provenance of the asset.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_is_provenance_always_complete"><a class="anchor" href="#_is_provenance_always_complete"></a>3.1.5. Is provenance always complete?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No. Provenance is not always complete. It may happen that an asset is modified in a way that the provenance data is not updated. For example, if an asset is cropped using a non-C2PA aware tool, the provenance data may not be updated to reflect that action.  However, if the asset is then brought back into a C2PA-aware tool for additional modification or preparation for publication, the actor responsible for signing the new C2PA Manifest also implicitly attests to the crop action. So even though there is missing provenance information, the asset can still be trusted based on the signer of the <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_active_manifest" class="xref page">active C2PA Manifest</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_trust"><a class="anchor" href="#_trust"></a>3.2. Trust</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_how_is_trust_in_digital_assets_established"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_is_trust_in_digital_assets_established"></a>3.2.1. How is trust in digital assets established?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the C2PA Specifications, trust decisions are made by the consumer of the asset based on the identity of the actor(s) who signed the provenance data along with the information in the assertions contained in the provenance. This signing takes place at each significant moment in an asset&#8217;s life (e.g., creation, editing, etc.) through the use of the actor&#8217;s unique credentials and ensures that the provenance data remains cryptographically bound to the newly created or updated asset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable consumers to make informed decisions about the provenance of an asset, and prevent unknown attackers from impersonating others, it is critical that each application and ecosystem reliably identify the actor to whom a signing credential (also known as a digital certificate) is issued. A <em>certification authority</em> (CA) performs this real-world due diligence to ensure signing credentials are only issued to actors who are whom they claim to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the world wide web, CAs verify that someone requesting a certificate to operate a secure web site owns and/or controls the site&#8217;s domain name before issuing such a credential. For example, before issuing a certificate for <a href="https://c2pa.org/" class="bare">https://c2pa.org/</a>, the CA verified the requester did in fact control C2PA&#8217;s domain name before issuing a certificate for that site name. Unlike the world wide web, C2PA will be used in multiple different application settings, and each setting will have its own requirements. Each application will therefore provide users with one or more <em>trust lists</em>, which are lists of certification authorities that issue signing credentials for that application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the signing credential is issued by a certification authority, the identity it has confirmed and placed in that credential cannot be altered by anyone else, including and especially the credential&#8217;s owner. This allows the consumer or user to rely upon the identity presented in a signed asset.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1. News and Media</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in a news and media aggregation application or web site, each newspaper, television network, or other media organization has a globally-recognized identity, and there is only one such organization that operates with that name. In this situation, because brand marks and other visual indicators can and have been reproduced for the purposes of impersonation, consumers want to be certain the media they are consuming actually comes from the source it claims to be. This application would provide at least one trust list maintained by a professional or non-profit organization for journalists and media, which endorses certification authorities that ensure such credentials are only issued to the genuine organization through real-world due diligence.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 2. Insurance Company</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In another example, an insurance company may employ provenance tracking for images, videos, and other media as part of underwriting policies and servicing loss claims to be used by its own employees. In this case, only one trust list is applicable: the insurance company&#8217;s own certification authority operated by its Human Resources department, which may already exist to employee credentials for other purposes. Here, it is not important that every participant have a unique name, as several employees may share the same name, but it is important to be assured all participants are employees of the insurance company, which the Human Resources department is certainly able to confirm and attest.</p>

<h4 id="_should_i_distrust_media_without_c2pa_provenance"><a class="anchor" href="#_should_i_distrust_media_without_c2pa_provenance"></a>3.2.2. Should I distrust media without C2PA provenance?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No. Adding provenance to an asset is optional, and it is not the intention of the specification and guidance to create a two-tier media ecosystem where assets without C2PA provenance data are universally less trusted than assets with it. The C2PA specification is open and available to everyone, and so no assumption should be made about the trustworthiness of a particular asset or signer purely based on their usage of C2PA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C2PA provenance only becomes useful to users when they can use the data and the signer&#8217;s identity to build a trust relationship with that signer. For example, if a well-known media publisher adds provenance data to an asset and signs it, a consumer that knows that publisher can use C2PA to understand that the asset and its provenance data definitely came from them, and wasn&#8217;t manipulated. Conversely, if a bad or unknown actor adds provenance data and signs it, a consumer would see the actor&#8217;s identity, and then make their own decision on whether to trust the asset and the provenance data.</p>

<h4 id="_do_the_ingredients_of_an_asset_have_verifiable_provenance"><a class="anchor" href="#_do_the_ingredients_of_an_asset_have_verifiable_provenance"></a>3.2.3. Do the ingredients of an asset have verifiable provenance?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_ingredient" class="xref page">ingredient</a> that is included in a C2PA Manifest can include its own provenance data, specifically its C2PA Manifest is also included in the asset&#8217;s C2PA Manifest Store. However, while the provenance data of each ingredient may be present, the ingredient&#8217;s provenance cannot be verified in the same way as the provenance data of the asset in which it is contained. This is because the actual data of the ingredient is not usually included in the asset&#8217;s C2PA Manifest. Without the actual data, the ingredient&#8217;s hard bindings cannot be verified.</p>

Can provenance information be used to determine whether a digital asset, such as an image or video, depicts the truth?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Provenance information can help establish the truth about the origin, history and authenticity of digital content, by providing evidence for its creation, discovery, ownership and movement over time; but provenance information alone cannot tell you whether the digital content is true, accurate or factual.</p>

<p>C2PA signed provenance information can include assertions about the real-world identity of the provider of those assertions and the digital asset to which they refer. This signature allows one to determine whether those the assertions or the digital asset itself were subsequently altered. This provides users the means to make a more informed decision about whether they believe the digital content is true, accurate or factual, based in part on the trust relationship they have with the provider of those assertions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Signed provenance information transits trust between a creator and a consumer, based on a trust relationship between those
two that exists outside the scope of C2PA. Trust anchors operate by providing digital identities within a particular
ecosystem that link to real-world identities, and perform an ecosystem-specific validation to ensure those identities are
sufficiently trustworthy, and that consumers can be confident when an asset is verified as being signed by a known creator, they can
rely upon their existing trust relationship with that known creator.&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<strong><em>C2PA Implementation Guidance <a href="#guidance:_trust">Trust Model</a></em></strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The provenance data and the asset are the two parts of the same puzzle - a unique puzzle. The possibility of any other pieces ever matching, either by coincidence or by purposeful creation, is so low that it would be practically impossible. This is known as a hard binding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This inability to always be able to verify the provenance of an ingredient is not problematic, because the trust of the asset remains in the signer of the asset&#8217;s C2PA Manifest. However, having the ingredient&#8217;s C2PA Manifest included in the asset&#8217;s C2PA Manifest Store, enables the verification of the ingredient&#8217;s assertions (which are important trust signals), even if its hard bindings cannot be validated.</p>

<p>Each action that is performed on an asset is recorded in the asset&#8217;s C2PA Manifest. These actions can be performed by a human or by an AI/ML system.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes. A C2PA Manifest include a <a href="../specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_training_and_data_mining" class="xref page">Training and Data Mining</a> assertion that can be used to indicate that the asset should not be used for either training or data mining purposes. The assertion is flexible and allows the author of the asset to specify whether each type of process - data mining, general AI training, or training specific to generative AI - is permitted, or not.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A photojournalist uses a C2PA-enabled capture device during a newsworthy event they are covering. The assets are then brought into a C2PA-enabled editing application, and after editing it, they are sent to a photo editor. The editor makes additional edits also using a C2PA-enabled application. The finalized asset is moved into the content management system of a news organization, which is also C2PA-enabled, before posting the asset to social media.</p>

<p>A news publisher is concerned about standards of public comprehension and brand value of its publications which it makes available online through a number of social media platforms.
